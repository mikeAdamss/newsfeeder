      "summary_original": "In recent years, Europe has transformed into a fertile ground for entrepreneurship and innovation. While Silicon Valley has long dominated the global startup scene, European countries are rapidly catching up, nurturing a unique ecosystem that fosters creativity, funding, and scalable business models. At the heart of this growth lies a new generation of startup founders who are solving pressing global challenges\u2014from fintech to sustainability and health tech. With support from government-backed programs, accelerator hubs, and university-led research, Europe's startup landscape is no longer fragmented but rather a well-connected network of innovation hubs. One of the most significant driving forces behind this momentum is the increased media coverage and exposure of startup news platforms. Outlets like StartupRad.io have become instrumental in bringing attention to emerging European ventures. These platforms provide entrepreneurs with a voice and an international stage to showcase their technologies, strategies, and impact stories. In parallel, venture capital investments in Europe have seen a steep upward trend. According to recent data, VC funding across the continent has reached record-breaking levels, crossing \u20ac100 billion in annual investment. This surge is not just concentrated in traditionally dominant markets like the UK and Germany but also spans countries like Estonia, Portugal, and Poland. As VC interest grows, founders are gaining the resources and mentorship needed to scale globally. The rise of startups Europe is further supported by cross-border collaboration. Initiatives like the European Innovation Council and EU-wide accelerators are helping startups access a broader market, talent pool, and investor base. These efforts are crucial for breaking down the barriers that once limited entrepreneurial ambition to national borders. Moreover, there is a notable shift in focus toward building sustainable and socially responsible businesses. Today's entrepreneurs are looking beyond profits to create lasting societal impact. Whether it's through carbon-neutral supply chains, green energy solutions, or mental health platforms, European startups are positioning themselves as ethical leaders in their sectors. A key part of this evolution is the emergence of the scaleup Europe model\u2014a framework that supports high-growth startups in transitioning into global enterprises. Unlike early-stage startups, scaleups require different resources: international market access, late-stage funding, and advanced hiring strategies. Europe has begun responding with tailored programs aimed specifically at this segment, offering mentorship, visibility, and strategic partnerships. Media outlets like StartupRad.io continue to shine a spotlight on these success stories, helping to boost their credibility and market presence. From exclusive interviews with founders to trend analysis and investment breakdowns, the content shared offers invaluable insights to anyone interested in the European tech ecosystem. The future looks bright as scaleup europes are now shaping the continent's economic landscape. These companies not only drive innovation but also generate employment, attract international talent, and reinforce Europe's position as a serious contender in the global startup race. \u2705 Meta Description: Explore how Europe's startup ecosystem is evolving through innovation, venture capital, and cross-border collaboration.

      "title": "Announcing etcd v3.6.0",
      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/",
      "summary": "-",
      "summary_original": "This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog. Today, we are releasing etcd v3.6.0, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release introduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and migration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical & major issues. It also includes major optimizations in memory usage, improving efficiency and performance. In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve project sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability. Through the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well. What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the roadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the CHANGELOG-3.6. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible! Security etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by integrating govulncheck to scan the source code and trivy to scan container images. These improvements have also been backported to supported stable releases. etcd continues to follow the Security Release Process to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed. Features Migration to v3store The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via --enable-v2. It remained the source of truth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the --enable-v2 flag has been removed, and v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data. While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information. To assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the etcdutl check v2store command, which verifies that v2store contains only membership data (see PR 19113). Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained storage engine moving forward. The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in issues/12913. Downgrade etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans both versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in issues/11716. At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5), followed by a rolling downgrade. Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid: $ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5 Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6 If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode: $ etcdctl downgrade enable 3.5 Downgrade enable success, cluster version 3.6 etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade. For details, refer to the Downgrade-3.6 guide. Feature gates In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we indicated unstable features through the --experimental prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed once the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress to Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users. See feature-gates for details. livez / readyz checks etcd now supports /livez and /readyz endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes. /livez indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while /readyz indicates when it is ready to serve requests. This feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29). See livez/readyz for details. The existing /health endpoint remains functional. /livez is similar to /health?serializable=true, while /readyz is similar to /health or /health?serializable=false. Clearly, the /livez and /readyz endpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand. v3discovery In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol v3discovery was introduced, based on clientv3. It facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase. The previous v2discovery protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally, the public discovery service at https://discovery.etcd.io/, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained. Performance Memory In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes: The default value of --snapshot-count has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5. Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in PR/18825. Figure 1: Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios. Each subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd v3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and more stable memory usage. Throughput Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10% in both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to any single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such example is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in PR/419. Figure 2: Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio. The read/write ratio is 0.0078, meaning 1 read per 128 writes. The right bar shows the percentage improvement in read throughput of v3.6.0-rc.2 over v3.5.20, ranging from 3.21% to 25.59%. Figure 3: Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high read ratio. The read/write ratio is 8, meaning 8 reads per write. The right bar shows the percentage improvement in read throughput of v3.6.0-rc.2 over v3.5.20, ranging from 4.38% to 27.20%. Figure 4: Write throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio. The read/write ratio is 0.0078, meaning 1 read per 128 writes. The right bar shows the percentage improvement in write throughput of v3.6.0-rc.2 over v3.5.20, ranging from 2.95% to 24.24%. Figure 5: Write throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high read ratio. The read/write ratio is 8, meaning 8 reads per write. The right bar shows the percentage improvement in write throughput of v3.6.0-rc.2 over v3.5.20, ranging from 3.86% to 28.37%. Breaking changes This section highlights a few notable breaking changes. For a complete list, please refer to the Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6 and the CHANGELOG-3.6. Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with data created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6. When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing the binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue. Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests Client endpoints (--advertise-client-urls) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer endpoints (--initial-advertise-peer-urls) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation oversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and encouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via PR/13565; peer endpoints no longer serve client requests. Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl Both etcdctl and etcdutl are command line tools. etcdutl is an offline utility designed to operate directly on etcd data files, while etcdctl is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some overlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0. Removed etcdctl defrag --data-dir The etcdctl defrag command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation. To perform offline defragmentation, use the etcdutl defrag --data-dir command instead. Removed etcdctl snapshot status etcdctl no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the etcdutl snapshot status command instead. Removed etcdctl snapshot restore etcdctl no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the etcdutl snapshot restore command instead. Critical bug fixes Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and fixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported to previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here. Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the data. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency (see issue/13766). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with PR/13854. Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might be lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see issue/14370) affecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with PR/14400, and fixed in raft side in main branch (now release-3.6) with PR/14413. Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply some entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue (see the discussions in PR/14685). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with PR/14730. Upgrade issue This section highlights a common issue issues/19557 in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade process to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6. The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20. Key takeaway: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading to etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail. For more background and technical context, see upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue. Testing We introduced the Robustness testing to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority. It plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random failpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a linearizability check. It also verifies that the Watch APIs guarantees have not been violated. The robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release. We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to take advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability for contributors to rerun failed tests themselves. Platforms While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support. For more details, please refer to issues/15951. For the complete list of supported platforms, see supported-platform. Dependencies Dependency bumping guide We have published an official guide on how to bump dependencies for etcd\u2019s main branch and stable releases. It also covers how to update the Go version. For more details, please refer to dependency_management. With this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades. Core Dependency Updates bbolt and raft are two core dependencies of etcd. Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4. For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5 do not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (raft), and the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0. As a result, etcd v3.6.0 depends on raft v3.6.0. Please see the table below for a summary: etcd versions bbolt versions raft versions 3.4.x v1.3.x N/A 3.5.x v1.3.x N/A 3.6.x v1.4.x v3.6.x grpc-gateway@v2 We upgraded grpc-gateway from v1 to v2 via PR/16595 in etcd v3.6.0. This is a major step toward migrating to protobuf-go, the second major version of the Go protocol buffer API implementation. grpc-gateway@v2 is designed to work with protobuf-go. However, etcd v3.6 still depends on the deprecated gogo/protobuf, which is actually protocol buffer v1 implementation. To resolve this incompatibility, we applied a patch to the generated *.pb.gw.go files to convert v1 messages to v2 messages. grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus We switched from the deprecated (and archived) grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus to grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus via PR/19195. This change ensures continued support and access to the latest features and improvements in the gRPC Prometheus integration. Community There are exciting developments in the etcd community that reflect our ongoing commitment to strengthening collaboration, improving maintainability, and evolving the project\u2019s governance. etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG etcd has officially become a Kubernetes Special Interest Group: SIG-etcd. This change reflects etcd\u2019s critical role as the primary datastore for Kubernetes and establishes a more structured and transparent home for long-term stewardship and cross-project collaboration. The new SIG designation will help streamline decision-making, align roadmaps with Kubernetes needs, and attract broader community involvement. New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers We\u2019ve seen increasing engagement from contributors, which has resulted in the addition of three new maintainers: fuweid jmhbnz wenjiaswe Their continued contributions have been instrumental in driving the project forward. We also welcome two new reviewers to the project: ivanvc siyuanfoundation We appreciate their dedication to code quality and their willingness to take on broader review responsibilities within the community. New release team We've formed a new release team led by ivanvc and jmhbnz, streamlining the release process by automating many previously manual steps. Inspired by Kubernetes SIG Release, we've adopted several best practices, including clearly defined release team roles and the introduction of release shadows to support knowledge sharing and team sustainability. These changes have made our releases smoother and more reliable, allowing us to approach each release with greater confidence and consistency. Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group To further advance etcd\u2019s operational excellence, we have formed a new working group: WG-etcd-operator. The working group is dedicated to enabling the automatic and efficient operation of etcd clusters that run in the Kubernetes environment using an etcd-operator. Future Development The legacy v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4, and the flag --enable-v2 was removed entirely in v3.6. This means that starting from v3.6, there is no longer a way to enable or use the v2store. However, etcd still bootstraps internally from the legacy v2 snapshots. To address this inconsistency, We plan to change etcd to bootstrap from the v3store and replay the WAL entries based on the consistent-index. The work is being tracked in issues/12913. One of the most persistent challenges remains the large range of queries from the kube-apiserver, which can lead to process crashes due to their unpredictable nature. The range stream feature, originally outlined in the v3.5 release blog/Future roadmaps, remains an idea worth revisiting to address the challenges of large range queries. For more details and upcoming plans, please refer to the etcd roadmap.",
      "summary_html": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/announcing-etcd-3.6/\">appeared</a> on the etcd blog.</em></p>\n<p>Today, we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0\">etcd v3.6.0</a>, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>For details, refer to the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/downgrades/downgrade_3_6/\">Downgrade-3.6</a> guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-gates\">Feature gates</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram of memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd\nv3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and\nmore stable memory usage.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"throughput\">Throughput</h3>\n<p>Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10%\nin both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>For details, refer to the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/downgrades/downgrade_3_6/\">Downgrade-3.6</a> guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-gates\">Feature gates</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram of memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd\nv3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and\nmore stable memory usage.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"throughput\">Throughput</h3>\n<p>Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10%\nin both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

For a complete list, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions</p>\n<p>Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with\ndata created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6.</p>\n<p>When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing\nthe binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peer-endpoints-no-longer-serve-client-requests\">Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests</h3>\n<p>Client endpoints (<code>--advertise-client-urls</code>) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer\nendpoints (<code>--initial-advertise-peer-urls</code>) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation\noversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and\nencouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13565\">PR/13565</a>; peer endpoints\nno longer serve client requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-boundary-between-etcdctl-and-etcdutl\">Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl</h3>\n<p>Both <code>etcdctl</code> and <code>etcdutl</code> are command line tools. <code>etcdutl</code> is an offline utility designed to operate directly on\netcd data files, while <code>etcdctl</code> is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some\noverlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl defrag --data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The <code>etcdctl defrag</code> command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation.\nTo perform offline defragmentation, use the <code>etcdutl defrag --data-dir</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot status</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot status</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot restore</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"critical-bug-fixes\">Critical bug fixes</h2>\n<p>Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and\nfixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported\nto previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the\ndata. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766\">issue/13766</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13854\">PR/13854</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might\nbe lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14370\">issue/14370</a>)\naffecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14400\">PR/14400</a>, and fixed in raft side in\nmain branch (now release-3.6) with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14413\">PR/14413</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply\nsome entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue\n(see the discussions in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14685\">PR/14685</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14730\">PR/14730</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-issue\">Upgrade issue</h2>\n<p>This section highlights a common issue <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557\">issues/19557</a> in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade\nprocess to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading\nto etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail.</p>\n<p>For more background and technical context, see <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/\">upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness\">Robustness testing</a> to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority.\nIt plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random\nfailpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a\nlinearizability check. It also verifies that the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api_guarantees/#watch-apis\">Watch APIs</a> guarantees have not been violated.\nThe robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release.</p>\n<p>We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to\ntake advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability\nfor contributors to rerun failed tests themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support.\nFor more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15951\">issues/15951</a>.

For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/dependency_management.md\">dependency_management</a>.\nWith this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-dependency-updates\">Core Dependency Updates</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt\">bbolt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a> are two core dependencies of etcd.</p>\n<p>Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4.</p>\n<p>For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5\ndo not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a>),\nand the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0. As a result, etcd v3.6.0 depends on raft v3.6.0.</p>\n<p>Please see the table below for a summary:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>etcd versions</th>\n<th>bbolt versions</th>\n<th>raft versions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3.4.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.5.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.6.x</td>\n<td>v1.4.x</td>\n<td>v3.6.x</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-gateway-v2\">grpc-gateway@v2</h3>\n<p>We upgraded <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway\">grpc-gateway</a> from v1 to v2 via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/16595\">PR/16595</a> in etcd v3.6.0.

      "summary": "The Python Software Foundation's Grants Program Transparency Report 2024 outlines key areas of the PSF\u2019s charitable mission and provides an analysis for program improvements.",
      "summary_original": "The PSF\u2019s Grants Program is a key plank in our charitable mission to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. After much research, input, and analysis, the PSF is pleased to share the PSF Grants Program 2024 Transparency Report. The report includes context, numbers, analysis, and next steps for the Program. Similar to our PSF Grants Program 2022 & 2023 Transparency Report, this 2024 report reflects the outcome of a significant amount of work. There are some differences in the position we are in as we approached the development of this report: The 2022 & 2023 report provided concrete areas for improvementDuring 2024, a notable amount of focused PSF Staff time was dedicated to improving our Grants Program and the processesThe PSF received and awarded a record-breaking amount of grants in 2024, which resulted in the need to re-evaluate the Program\u2019s goals and sustainabilityThe data from 2024 was truly wonderful to see (many WOW\u2019s and \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73 were shared among PSF Staff)\u2013 and we are so happy to share it with the community. The PSF is also excited to share that we achieved many of the goals we listed in the 2022 & 2023 report and believe this is a reflection of the focused work we undertook in 2024. Even with these wins, the PSF recognizes multiple opportunities to continue to improve the Program. We are also aware that our recent sustainability-focused changes to the Program will likely result in the need for additional improvements and adjustments. The PSF continues to feel it is important to acknowledge that individual Pythonistas, regional communities, and the broader community are behind these statistics and commentaries. This report reflects the outcome of thousands of hours of efforts over 2024, 2023, and 2022 by the Grants Workgroup, the PSF Board, Python organizers, and PSF Staff worldwide. The PSF truly values this opportunity to share information on the success and challenges of our Grants Program, all while honoring the hard work of everyone involved in making the program and our mission possible.This report was compiled by PSF Staff and reviewed by the PSF Board and Grants Workgroup. If you have questions, comments, or feedback about the Grants Program or this report, please email grants@python.org or attend a session of the Grants Program Office Hours on the PSF Discord. Setting ContextThe PSF has been working to improve our Grants Program since receiving a call from our community to address concerns and frustrations in December 2023. Our 2022 & 2023 report listed the actions the PSF has taken since we first received the call, and we are happy to share that since publishing our last report, the PSF Board, Grants Workgroup, and Staff have:Held monthly Grants Program Office Hours (now past its 1st anniversary) with much success and active participation at every session, and we plan to continue these indefinitely!Strategized at the PSF Board retreat, which resulted in Guiding Principles for the Grants ProgramEvaluated the Grants Program expenditure using grant data to conduct scenario analysis and ensure long-term program and foundation sustainability. Updated the Grants Workgroup Charter twice: The first update was focused on process improvements (part 1, part 2).The second update was focused on sustainability (TLDR, part 1, part 2, part 3).Ensured active Grants Workgroup engagement by conducting a confirmation of the workgroup memberships.Updated the main documentation page for the Grants Program to improve clarity around the program\u2019s processes, requirements, and what applicants can expect.Updated the Grants Program application form to clarify questions that caused confusion, and added more questions to help us better review applications and perform additional grant data analysis in the future.Revamped the former virtual events resource page to be an Event Organizer Resource Library to include more types of resources and information for grant applicants.For a high-level idea of the scope of our Grants Program, the PSF is happy to share:The PSF distributed $952K in Grants during 2024 for the Grants and PyCon US Travel Grants Programs combined, an increase of over 50% over 2023\u2019s total. The Grants Program distributed $637K In Grants during 2024. A couple of additional notes:This transparency report is focused on the Grants Program only. If you want to learn more about travel grants check out the Travel Grants Process for PyCon US 2025 blog post on the PyCon US blog. Across this report and our communications about grants, \u201cdistributed\u201d means funds that were paid, and \u201cawarded\u201d means funds that were resolved to be distributed. While a subtle difference, there can be discrepancies between \u201cawarded\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d figures for several reasons, such as grant recipients that never claim their awards, or grants that were awarded at the end of December but weren\u2019t paid until January. We discovered a corner case on applications and how data is gathered for this report; applications that were received in 2023 but weren\u2019t voted on until 2024 were not included in the 2022 & 2023 report. Those are included in this report. The following report will be on the 119 grants that the PSF reviewed during the year 2024.Again, the growth the PSF Grants Program has seen from 2022 to 2024 (and over the years) is exciting to reflect on because of what it means\u2013 you, the community, are wonderfully thriving and active! The PSF can\u2019t wait to see what 2025 has in store for our Grants Program and the Python community. The numbers (in graph form) Thanks to Tania Allard for helping improve the readability and accessibility of the graphs provided in this report. Our Analysis General Trends, Observations, & NotesThe increase in total grant applications we received from 2024 over 2023, and again over 2022, is exciting! We anticipated more applications coming in throughout 2024 and we were correct. With the recent changes to our Grants Program, the trends we\u2019ve seen in Q1 of 2025, and the funding crunch in the tech sector, we anticipate receiving even more applications in 2025.Beyond just more applications, we had more of a lot; more successful grant applications, more funds awarded, more communications, more changes to the Program, and more dedicated PSF Staff time! Number of Total Grant Applications by ContinentSimilar to last year\u2019s report, we received the most number of applications from Africa and Europe, with South America not far behind. The number of grant applications from almost all continents have continued to increase 2024 over 2023, and have more than doubled over the total number of applications we received in 2022.Percentage of Grants ApprovedThe percentage of approved applications increased 2024 over 2023. We feel this increase can be attributed to the direct line of communications applicants have to program administrators via the PSF Grants Program Office Hours. Some reasons applications were denied include:Unable to meet PSF Grants Program criteriaUnclear benefit to funding the applicationNot Python relatedSpamPercentage of Grant Applications by ContinentAgain in 2024, we received fewer applications from Asia, North America, and Oceania. Oceania is an outlier. Based on the distribution of populations globally, the percentage of applications from Asia is lower than expected. While we want to note that we cannot award Grants to certain countries due to United States OFAC restrictions that US-based 501(c)(3)s must follow, we again urge organizers from Asia to request Grant funding to supplement and enhance their events. While the number of applications we\u2019ve received have continued to increase, the distribution of grant applications across continents has remained relatively stable from 2022-2024. We do want to note a small but steady increase in the percentage of grant applications from Africa and North America, and a small decrease in applications from South America.Approved & Declined Grant Applications by ContinentThe ratio of approved to declined grant applications (87.5% approved, 12.5% declined in 2024) from Africa is positive, as this was a stated area for improvement in last year\u2019s report (68% approved, 32% declined in 2023). We believe this can be at least partially attributed to the PSF Grants Program Office Hours, plus more communications regarding how the Program works and the changes occurring around it.Dollar Amount Granted by Continent & Percentage of Money Granted by ContinentThe amount granted to Africa more than doubled 2024 over 2023, and more than 14 times the amount granted to Africa in 2022! As we also received the most grant applications from Africa in 2024, we feel this outcome is positive. Comparing the percentages of grant applications by continent versus the percentages of money granted by continent, we feel it is positive that these percentages closely match (i.e. awarding of funds is roughly equivalent to the percentage of applications across continents) with a couple points of difference. The total amount of funds granted doubled 2023 over 2022 and again almost doubled 2024 over 2023. This continued dramatic increase resulted in our recent changes to the Grants Program to ensure the program\u2019s sustainability. The amount of funds awarded to Asia and South America are low compared to other continents taking into account global population distributions. While this aligns with the number of applications we received from these regions (i.e. the percentage of funds awarded and percentage of accepted applications for these regions are close), we would like to understand if the low number of applications is due to activity level, lack of awareness, or other factors. Average Amount Granted by ContinentOceania continues to be an outlier; the PSF received one application in 2022, two in 2023, and two in 2024 from Oceania. Many more grants were awarded to other regions, which caused their average dollar amounts to be lower. The average dollar amount across the rest of the continents are reasonably close, and we are pleased to see the average amount granted to Africa has risen. Asia and South America are still lagging behind, which could be attributed to the type of grant requests we receive from that region (such as Django Girls workshop versus PyCons) and the amounts being requested. And the reverse side of that\u2013 grant applications from North America tend to be for conferences and not workshops or small events, hence the larger average amount granted.Grant Decision Times in Weeks by Number & Percentage of ApplicationsWe are pleased to see that the majority of the grant review period falls around 4 and 5 weeks, which is reasonable based on the process and load of grant applications we received. When we reviewed applications that took longer than 6-8 weeks to decide, we found one scenario in particular continues to arise. Applications are sometimes submitted without crucial information, and there is significant time spent on communications between applicants, PSF Staff, and the Grants Workgroup. Once requested, there are can be delays in receiving the required information back from applicants. Grants Program Average Days to Decide by ContinentThe average days to decide across continents is generally similar, with a few exceptions for Asia and Oceania being shorter. This graph also shows Oceania as an outlier, and, again, it is skewed because we received only two applications in 2024 from that region. The average number of days to decide for grant applications for Asia was high in 2023 at 45 days, and we are pleased to see that decrease significantly in 2024 to 25 days. We are pleased to see the average number of days to come to a decision regarding grant applications has decreased to 28 days in 2024 over 32 days in 2023. We feel this can be attributed to process improvements, Grants Workgroup engagement, and more dedicated time from PSF Staff. Next steps and a final noteAs the PSF reflects on all the successes of the Grants Program in 2024, we are preparing ourselves for even more adjustments to come with the updated Program and Grants Workgroup Charter. Some of our goals for 2025 include:Continue building the Event Organizer Resource Library.Continue hosting the Grants Program Office Hours to increase ongoing transparency, support grant applicants, and identify and close any gaps in our updated documentation.Monitor and evaluate the Grants Program awards on a quarterly, bi-annual, and yearly basis to ensure Program and Foundation sustainability.Revisit the effectiveness and sustainability of the Grants Program yearly. Continue to analyze, discuss, and compare the actual state of our Grants Program against the Guiding Principles for the program. Work to first understand why we are receiving a proportionately lower number of applications from Asia and South America. The PSF hopes this transparency report will help our community understand the state of our Grants Program in 2024, and the previous two years. Again, the process has been instructive to the Board, the Grants Workgroup, and the PSF Staff who administer the Program to understand where our efforts paid off, and where we can continue to improve. This report will inform our future efforts as we continue to make adjustments and improvements to the program. The PSF looks forward to continuing to serve the Python community with grants in 2025!If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please email grants@python.org. We also welcome you to attend a session of the Grants Program Office Hours on the PSF Discord (the next session is Tuesday, May 20th, at 9 AM Eastern, 1 PM UTC!).",

Oceania is an outlier. Based on the distribution of populations globally, the percentage of applications from Asia is lower than expected. While we want to note that we cannot award Grants to certain countries due to United States OFAC restrictions that US-based 501(c)(3)s must follow, we again urge organizers from Asia to request Grant funding to supplement and enhance their events. </li><li>While the number of applications we\u2019ve received have continued to increase, the distribution of grant applications across continents has remained relatively stable from 2022-2024. We do want to note a small but steady increase in the percentage of grant applications from Africa and North America, and a small decrease in applications from South America.</li></ul><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Approved &amp; Declined Grant Applications by Continent</h4><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The ratio of approved to declined grant applications (87.5% approved, 12.5% declined in 2024) from Africa is positive, as this was a stated area for improvement in last year\u2019s report (68% approved, 32% declined in 2023). We believe this can be at least partially attributed to the PSF Grants Program Office Hours, plus more communications regarding how the Program works and the changes occurring around it.</li></ul><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Dollar Amount Granted by Continent &amp; Percentage of Money Granted by Continent</h4><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The amount granted to Africa more than doubled 2024 over 2023, and more than 14 times the amount granted to Africa in 2022! As we also received the most grant applications from Africa in 2024, we feel this outcome is positive. </li><li>Comparing the percentages of grant applications by continent versus the percentages of money granted by continent, we feel it is positive that these percentages closely match (i.e. awarding of funds is roughly equivalent to the percentage of applications across continents) with a couple points of difference. </li><li>The total amount of funds granted doubled 2023 over 2022 and again almost doubled 2024 over 2023. This continued dramatic increase resulted in our recent changes to the Grants Program to ensure the program\u2019s sustainability. </li><li>The amount of funds awarded to Asia and South America are low compared to other continents taking into account global population distributions. While this aligns with the number of applications we received from these regions (i.e. the percentage of funds awarded and percentage of accepted applications for these regions are close), we would like to understand if the low number of applications is due to activity level, lack of awareness, or other factors. </li></ul><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Average Amount Granted by Continent</h4><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Oceania continues to be an outlier; the PSF received one application in 2022, two in 2023, and two in 2024 from Oceania. Many more grants were awarded to other regions, which caused their average dollar amounts to be lower. </li><li>The average dollar amount across the rest of the continents are reasonably close, and we are pleased to see the average amount granted to Africa has risen. </li><li>Asia and South America are still lagging behind, which could be attributed to the type of grant requests we receive from that region (such as Django Girls workshop versus PyCons) and the amounts being requested. And the reverse side of that\u2013 grant applications from North America tend to be for conferences and not workshops or small events, hence the larger average amount granted.</li></ul><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Grant Decision Times in Weeks by Number &amp; Percentage of Applications</h4><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>We are pleased to see that the majority of the grant review period falls around 4 and 5 weeks, which is reasonable based on the process and load of grant applications we received. </li><li>When we reviewed applications that took longer than 6-8 weeks to decide, we found one scenario in particular continues to arise. Applications are sometimes submitted without crucial information, and there is significant time spent on communications between applicants, PSF Staff, and the Grants Workgroup. Once requested, there are can be delays in receiving the required information back from applicants. </li></ul><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Grants Program Average Days to Decide by Continent</h4><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The average days to decide across continents is generally similar, with a few exceptions for Asia and Oceania being shorter. This graph also shows Oceania as an outlier, and, again, it is skewed because we received only two applications in 2024 from that region. The average number of days to decide for grant applications for Asia was high in 2023 at 45 days, and we are pleased to see that decrease significantly in 2024 to 25 days. </li><li>We are pleased to see the average number of days to come to a decision regarding grant applications has decreased to 28 days in 2024 over 32 days in 2023. We feel this can be attributed to process improvements, Grants Workgroup engagement, and more dedicated time from PSF Staff.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Next steps and a final note</h2><p>As the PSF reflects on all the successes of the Grants Program in 2024, we are preparing ourselves for even more adjustments to come with the updated Program and Grants Workgroup Charter. Some of our goals for 2025 include:<br /></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Continue building the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/psf/grants/free-resources/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Organizer Resource Library</a>.</li><li>Continue hosting the Grants Program Office Hours to increase ongoing transparency, support grant applicants, and identify and close any gaps in our updated documentation.</li><li>Monitor and evaluate the Grants Program awards on a quarterly, bi-annual, and yearly basis to ensure Program and Foundation sustainability.</li><li>Revisit the effectiveness and sustainability of the Grants Program yearly. </li><li>Continue to analyze, discuss, and compare the actual state of our Grants Program against the Guiding Principles for the program. </li><li>Work to first understand why we are receiving a proportionately lower number of applications from Asia and South America. </li></ul><p><br />The PSF hopes this transparency report will help our community understand the state of our Grants Program in 2024, and the previous two years. Again, the process has been instructive to the Board, the Grants Workgroup, and the PSF Staff who administer the Program to understand where our efforts paid off, and where we can continue to improve. This report will inform our future efforts as we continue to make adjustments and improvements to the program.

After much research, input, and \nanalysis, the PSF is pleased to share the PSF Grants Program 2024 \nTransparency Report. The report includes context, numbers, analysis, and\n next steps for the Program. <br /><br />Similar to our <a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html\" target=\"_blank\">PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report</a>,\n this 2024 report reflects the outcome of a significant amount of work. \nThere are some differences in the position we are in as we approached \nthe development of this report: <br /></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The 2022 &amp; 2023 report provided concrete areas for improvement</li><li>During 2024, a notable amount of focused PSF Staff time was dedicated to improving our Grants Program and the processes</li><li>The\n PSF received and awarded a record-breaking amount of grants in 2024, \nwhich resulted in the need to re-evaluate the Program\u2019s goals and \nsustainability</li></ul><p>The data from 2024 was truly wonderful to\n see (many WOW\u2019s and \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73 were shared among PSF Staff)\u2013 and we are so \nhappy to share it with the community. The PSF is also excited to share \nthat we achieved many of the goals we listed in the 2022 &amp; 2023 \nreport and believe this is a reflection of the focused work we undertook\n in 2024. Even with these wins, the PSF recognizes multiple \nopportunities to continue to improve the Program. We are also aware that\n our recent sustainability-focused changes to the Program will likely \nresult in the need for additional improvements and adjustments. <br /><br />The\n PSF continues to feel it is important to acknowledge that individual \nPythonistas, regional communities, and the broader community are behind \nthese statistics and commentaries. This report reflects the outcome of \nthousands of hours of efforts over 2024, 2023, and 2022 by the Grants \nWorkgroup, the PSF Board, Python organizers, and PSF Staff worldwide. \nThe PSF truly values this opportunity to share information on the \nsuccess and challenges of our Grants Program, all while honoring the \nhard work of everyone involved in making the program and our mission \npossible.<br /><br />This report was compiled by PSF Staff and reviewed by \nthe PSF Board and Grants Workgroup.

While a subtle difference, there can be discrepancies \nbetween \u201cawarded\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d figures for several reasons, such as\n grant recipients that never claim their awards, or grants that were \nawarded at the end of December but weren\u2019t paid until January. </li><li>We\n discovered a corner case on applications and how data is gathered for \nthis report; applications that were received in 2023 but weren\u2019t voted \non until 2024 were not included in the 2022 &amp; 2023 report.

We anticipated more applications coming in throughout 2024 and we were correct.
