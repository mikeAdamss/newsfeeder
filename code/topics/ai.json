Updating a database schema as part of your development process often feels more complicated than it should be. If you\u2019ve ever worked with tools like SQLAlchemy, Alembic, or EF Core, you probably know the drill: you first update your model classes in code, then generate a migration file, and finally apply those changes to your database. It's not a terrible process\u2014but it's slow, easy to mess up with the correct migration order, and repetitive. You constantly have to switch contexts: from writing model code, to terminal commands, to reviewing raw SQL. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier if you could just describe what you want in English and let your tools handle the rest? Let\u2019s say we\u2019re working on a simple travel agency database model. We already have a user table, and now we want to add an address column to store where each user lives. Instead of manually changing the SQL or model file, imagine simply typing: \u201cAdd an address field to the user table as a string\u201d And immediately, the model gets updated (e.g., User class in Python, Java, C#, or JavaScript, depending on the language you use), the SQL schema is regenerated, and a pull request is opened in your GitHub repo\u2014complete with changes and documentation. This is exactly what we\u2019ll walk through using GitHub Copilot chat and GibsonAI, which automates schema changes, model generation, and PR creation. You can try to see the generated sample PR on this public repo: Here\u2019s a short demo that shows the workflow in VS Code: How the Database Schema to PR Agent Works The solution uses GibsonAI MCP Server for database operations and GitHub CLI for repository management in GitHub Copilot chat. Here\u2019s what happens step by step: Describe your schema change Example: \"Add an address column to the user table as a string\" GibsonAI applies the schema change It updates the database schema using the correct SQL syntax. GitHub Copilot generates the Python model Copilot clones the repository, opens a new branch and commits changed files behind the scenes. This includes Pydantic or SQLAlchemy files based on your stack, and respond from GibsonAI schema update to keep your code in sync with database changes. GitHub Copilot opens a GitHub Pull Request You get a PR with the updated model, schema changes, and docs. Let's see an example of how you can make database schema changes and automatically generate corresponding Python model classes with a GitHub PR. Step 1: Set Up Your Environment You\u2019ll need the following tools installed before you begin: Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot enabled UV package manager installed GitHub CLI is installed to connect and manage your GitHub repositories from GitHub Copilot A GibsonAI account (free) to use the database MCP server You can also use other editors like Cursor, Windsurf, and connect to the MCP server. Step 2: Install and Log In via CLI Open your terminal and run: uvx --from gibson-cli@latest gibson auth login This logs you into the GibsonAI CLI so you can access all the features directly from your terminal and integrate it into your workflow. Step 3: Enable the MCP Server in VS Code To use the schema assistant inside VS Code, create a .vscode/ folder in your project and inside it, a file named mcp.json. This file tells VS Code which MCP server to run. Paste the following configuration: { \"inputs\": [], \"servers\": { \"gibson\": { \"type\": \"stdio\", \"command\": \"uvx\", \"args\": [\"--from\", \"gibson-cli@latest\", \"gibson\", \"mcp\", \"run\"] } } } This setup launches the server locally and connects it with Copilot Chat. If you're using other tools like Cursor or Claude Desktop, you can configure them similarly. Step 4: Describe the Schema Change Now, inside Copilot Chat, just say: \u201cAdd an address column to the user table as a string\u201d Behind the scenes, this does four things: Applies the schema change to a real (serverless) database using GibsonAI Generates the updated Python model using Pydantic/SQLAlchemy Prepares documentation for the changes Opens a GitHub Pull Request in your connected repo You can see an example of this in action: \ud83d\udd17 Pull Request Preview What Makes This Unique? Compared to other AI coding assistants, this introduces a full-stack AI workflow that bridges coding, database management, and CI/CD: Smart Migration Ordering: Automatically resolves dependencies and applies changes in the right sequence (e.g., creating tables before adding constraints). Schema Validation: Test changes on an isolated development database before merging, preventing unexpected production issues. Schema Diff & ERD Diagrams: Automatically generates schema diffs and ERDs in PRs, making schema change reviews faster and more visual. Schema-Only Database Environments: Quickly spins up lightweight database environments with just schema (no production data), perfect for testing with anonymized/mock data. Final Thoughts This setup is cutting my dev time by around 20% when handling database schema changes. The approach doesn\u2019t just speed up development but also reduces errors in migrations, saves time switching between tools, and brings schema evolution closer to how we already think and communicate as developers. The biggest win? Each feature branch gets its own isolated database environment. Next time you want to update your database, try typing a prompt and feel free to leave your comments on Discord if you find this AI-assistant workflow useful.",

      "summary_original": "\ud83d\udccc TL;DR OpenTelemetry Weaver is a powerful tool that brings observability-by-design into practice. It empowers teams to standardize, automate, and maintain telemetry data through semantic conventions\u2014offering type safety, validation, documentation, and deployment in one package ([OpenTelemetry][1]). Why Weaver Matters Weaver addresses common issues in telemetry reliability and consistency: Broken alerts due to metric name changes Hard-to-read queries from inconsistent naming Undocumented telemetry leading to confusion Missing instrumentation, only discovered in production ([GitHub][2]) By treating telemetry signals (traces, metrics, logs) like code APIs, Weaver ensures they are versioned, consistent, and documented upfront. Core Features OTel Weaver supports: Capability Description Schema Definition Define telemetry schemas via semantic conventions. Validation Validate telemetry against defined schemas manually or in CI. Type-safe Code Gen Generate idiomatic client SDKs (Go, Rust, etc.) from those schemas. Documentation Gen Auto-generate markdown docs for your signals. Live Checking Integrate in CI or runtime to ensure emitted telemetry conforms ([Honeycomb][3], [GitHub][2], [GitHub][4]). How It Works At its core, Weaver is a CLI and platform tool that uses a schema-first workflow: Search or resolve semantic convention registries and schemas. Validate schemas via the CLI. Generate client SDKs, docs, or dashboards using its built\u2011in template engine or custom WASM plugins ([GitHub][4]). Current Maturity & Roadmap Versioned as CLI v0.X, Weaver is production-ready with active releases (v0.16.1 as of July 4, 2025) ([GitHub][2]) Future roadmap includes expanding language support, integrating OTel Arrow Protocol, adding SDK masking, obfuscation, and a richer ecosystem with WASM plugins for data catalogs, privacy compliance, dashboards, and more ([GitHub][4]).

Today, I'm not just exploring Generative AI\u2014I\u2019m building it. In this blog, I want to take you behind the scenes and walk you through the exact steps I\u2019m following to develop a custom Generative AI solution\u2014one that\u2019s not only powerful but tailored for real-world business use. Key Point : Anyone can build custom Generative AI with the right tools and data. Fine-tuning LLaMA 3 makes AI smarter, faster, and domain-specific. Success in AI needs clean data, smart deployment, and ethical design. Whether you\u2019re an AI enthusiast, a startup founder, or a tech strategist, this blueprint will show you what it takes to build and deploy a successful Generative AI system. Step 1: Defining the Mission \u2013 What My Generative AI Will Do Before touching any code, I started by answering the most critical question: \u201cWhat exactly should my Generative AI generate?\u201d My use case is multi-faceted. I want the model to: Generate text for blogs, marketing copy, and chat interfaces Potentially scale into multimodal applications involving text-to-image or code generation. Integrate seamlessly into digital workflows (like CMSs, CRMs, and e-commerce platforms) The clearer the goal, the smarter the build. I framed my vision around solving content automation challenges for modern businesses, particularly those in marketing, e-commerce, and software. TechVerdi helps you turn ideas into powerful generative AI solutions tailored to your goals. From building custom language models to integrating AI into your workflows, we use top tools like LLaMA 3, Hugging Face, and FastAPI to deliver smart, scalable, and future-ready systems. Step 2: Curating Domain-Specific Data Once I had set my goal, I knew the next step was to acquire and prepare the data. For my AI to generate meaningful and accurate content, I needed to train or fine-tune it on: Industry-relevant articles, landing pages, and knowledge bases Customer support conversations and chat logs Product catalogs and service descriptions I built a custom pipeline to clean, filter, and structure the data using Python and tools such as spaCy, pandas, and LangChain. Privacy and compliance were also top of mind, especially if this AI were to handle user data, so GDPR principles were integrated from the beginning. Step 3: Choosing the Right Model Architecture Here\u2019s where things got technical. I evaluated several pre-trained Generative AI models such as GPT-J, LLaMA 3, and Mistral, but ultimately chose to work with open-source transformer architectures via Hugging Face. Why? Because they give me full control to fine-tune and adapt the model to my domain, and I can scale as needed. I used: LLaMA 3 for its performance-to-parameter ratio QLoRA for memory-efficient fine-tuning Hugging Face Transformers for loading, modifying, and deploying the model Step 4: Fine-Tuning the Model to My Needs Instead of training from scratch (which requires massive computing resources), I opted for fine-tuning a pre-trained model. This allowed me to inject domain knowledge into the model without needing billions of tokens. My process: Tokenized my curated dataset using TokenizerFast Applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and QLoRA Used a GPU-accelerated environment via AWS Sagemaker for faster training cycles This stage was where the AI started to feel \u201cmine\u201d\u2014it began generating outputs aligned with the tone, vocabulary, and objectives I had defined earlier. We offer complete support\u2014from cloud infrastructure with AWS SageMaker to real-time monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. Our use of Docker, Kubernetes, and Streamlit ensures smooth deployment and high performance across all environments. Step 5: Evaluating Output Quality I didn\u2019t just assume the model was working well\u2014I measured it. I used: BLEU and ROUGE scores for automated text quality metrics Manual review of outputs by subject matter experts Human evaluations for tone, fluency, and relevance These evaluations helped identify areas where more training was needed, and what kinds of prompts or data adjustments would improve results. Step 6: Deploying the AI System Once confident in the outputs, I moved on to deployment. I containerized the model using Docker and built a FastAPI-based microservice to expose it as a REST API. For demonstration and testing, I integrated it into a Streamlit dashboard that allowed live prompting and result visualization. Later stages included: CI/CD pipeline for model versioning and rollbacks Kubernetes for scalable deployment across cloud infrastructure Integration with client-facing tools (web platforms, CRMs, etc.) Step 7: Real-Time Monitoring & Iteration Deployment is never the end, especially with AI. I implemented real-time logging and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to track: Latency and performance Prompt input/output patterns User engagement levels Plus, I set up a feedback loop where human reviewers can flag outputs for further retraining. The model evolves over time, continuously improving its creativity and reliability. TechVerdi\u2019s custom generative AI development services are designed to help businesses deploy intelligent, scalable, and responsible AI solutions.

This allowed me to inject domain knowledge into the model without needing billions of tokens.</p>\n\n<p>My process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tokenized my curated dataset using TokenizerFast</li>\n<li>Applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and QLoRA</li>\n<li>Used a GPU-accelerated environment via AWS Sagemaker for faster training cycles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This stage was where the AI started to feel \u201cmine\u201d\u2014it began generating outputs aligned with the tone, vocabulary, and objectives I had defined earlier.</p>\n\n<p>We offer complete support\u2014from cloud infrastructure with AWS SageMaker to real-time monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. Our use of Docker, Kubernetes, and Streamlit ensures smooth deployment and high performance across all environments.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Evaluating Output Quality\n</h2>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t just assume the model was working well\u2014I measured it.</p>\n\n<p>I used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BLEU and ROUGE scores for automated text quality metrics</li>\n<li>Manual review of outputs by subject matter experts</li>\n<li>Human evaluations for tone, fluency, and relevance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These evaluations helped identify areas where more training was needed, and what kinds of prompts or data adjustments would improve results.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Deploying the AI System\n</h2>\n\n<p>Once confident in the outputs, I moved on to deployment.</p>\n\n<p>I containerized the model using Docker and built a FastAPI-based microservice to expose it as a REST API. For demonstration and testing, I integrated it into a Streamlit dashboard that allowed live prompting and result visualization.</p>\n\n<p>Later stages included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CI/CD pipeline for model versioning and rollbacks</li>\n<li>Kubernetes for scalable deployment across cloud infrastructure</li>\n<li>Integration with client-facing tools (web platforms, CRMs, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Real-Time Monitoring &amp; Iteration\n</h2>\n\n<p>Deployment is never the end, especially with AI. I implemented real-time logging and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to track:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Latency and performance</li>\n<li>Prompt input/output patterns</li>\n<li>User engagement levels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus, I set up a feedback loop where human reviewers can flag outputs for further retraining. The model evolves over time, continuously improving its creativity and reliability.</p>\n\n<p>TechVerdi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.techverdi.com/generative-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom generative AI development services</a> are designed to help businesses deploy intelligent, scalable, and responsible AI solutions.

      "summary_original": "Python is a versatile language used across a wide range of applications\u2014from web development to data science. When it comes to handling collections of data efficiently, arrays play a key role, especially in performance-sensitive tasks. While Python lists are commonly used, arrays offer better memory management and faster computation, particularly with numerical data. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore how arrays work in Python, understand the differences between lists and arrays, and walk through essential tips, tricks, and best practices to help you master arrays like a pro. What is a Python Array? A Python array is a data structure that stores elements of the same data type in a contiguous memory block. This makes them more efficient than lists when working with numerical data. Arrays can be created using the built-in array module or through third-party libraries like NumPy, which is preferred in scientific and data-intensive applications. Basic Syntax Using the array Module: from array import array numbers = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # 'i' denotes integer type Array vs List: Key Differences Feature Array List Data Type Homogeneous (same type) Heterogeneous (any type) Performance Faster for numeric operations Slower for large data Memory Usage Less More Flexibility Less flexible More flexible Use arrays when speed and memory matter, especially with large datasets or numeric computation. For general-purpose tasks, lists are sufficient. Tip 1: Choose NumPy for Real Power While the built-in array module works, NumPy is the gold standard for numerical arrays in Python. It supports multi-dimensional arrays, vectorized operations, and a suite of mathematical functions that make data processing faster and easier. Example: import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) print(arr * 2) # Output: [2 4 6 8] With NumPy, you can manipulate arrays using just a few lines of code, replacing complex loops and conditions. Tip 2: Use Vectorized Operations Instead of Loops One of the most powerful features of arrays in NumPy is vectorization. Instead of writing loops to process data, you can apply operations directly on arrays. Traditional Loop: result = [] for i in range(len(arr)): result.append(arr[i] * 2) Vectorized Approach: result = arr * 2 This not only simplifies your code but also significantly boosts performance. Tip 3: Use Array Slicing for Efficient Data Access Array slicing allows you to extract or modify subsets of an array easily. arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) print(arr[1:4]) # Output: [20 30 40] Slicing is efficient because it doesn\u2019t copy the data; it returns a view, which is much faster and uses less memory. Tip 4: Beware of Data Type (dtype) Pitfalls Arrays are type-specific. Always keep an eye on the dtype of your array, especially when importing or performing operations. A mismatch can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. arr = np.array([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], dtype=int) print(arr) # Output: [1 2 3] In this case, the decimal part is truncated because we set the data type as integer. Tip 5: Use Array Functions for Faster Operations NumPy offers a rich set of built-in functions such as sum(), mean(), max(), min(), and more. These functions are optimized in C and offer superior performance. arr = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20]) print(np.mean(arr)) # Output: 12.5 Whenever possible, rely on these functions instead of writing custom logic. Tip 6: Master Multi-Dimensional Arrays Arrays aren\u2019t limited to one dimension. You can work with 2D, 3D, or even higher-dimensional arrays. matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) print(matrix[0][1]) # Output: 2 Understanding how to traverse and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays is essential for tasks like image processing, machine learning, and data analysis. Best Practices When Using Python Arrays \u2705 Pre-allocate memory for large arrays instead of appending elements in loops. \u2705 Use NumPy for numerical arrays\u2014it\u2019s faster and more feature-rich. \u2705 Avoid unnecessary conversions between lists and arrays. \u2705 Profile your code to check if using arrays improves performance in your specific use case. Final Thoughts Arrays are a fundamental part of Python programming, especially in performance-critical applications like data science, game development, or real-time systems. By mastering array operations, understanding type specificity, and leveraging tools like NumPy, you can write faster, cleaner, and more efficient code.",

When it comes to handling collections of data efficiently, <strong>arrays</strong> play a key role, especially in performance-sensitive tasks. While <a href=\"https://www.tpointtech.com/python-lists\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python lists</a> are commonly used, arrays offer better memory management and faster computation, particularly with numerical data.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog, we\u2019ll explore <strong>how arrays work in Python</strong>, understand the <strong>differences between lists and arrays</strong>, and walk through <strong>essential tips, tricks, and best practices</strong> to help you master arrays like a pro.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is a Python Array?\n</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.tpointtech.com/python-arrays\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python array</a> is a data structure that stores elements of the <strong>same data type</strong> in a contiguous memory block. This makes them more <strong>efficient</strong> than lists when working with numerical data. Arrays can be created using the built-in <code>array</code> module or through third-party libraries like <strong>NumPy</strong>, which is preferred in scientific and data-intensive applications.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Basic Syntax Using the <code>array</code> Module:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">array</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">array</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">array</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># 'i' denotes integer type\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Array vs List: Key Differences\n</h2>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Array</th>\n<th>List</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Type</td>\n<td>Homogeneous (same type)</td>\n<td>Heterogeneous (any type)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>Faster for numeric operations</td>\n<td>Slower for large data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Usage</td>\n<td>Less</td>\n<td>More</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flexibility</td>\n<td>Less flexible</td>\n<td>More flexible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p>Use arrays when <strong>speed and memory</strong> matter, especially with large datasets or numeric computation. For general-purpose tasks, lists are sufficient.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 1: Choose NumPy for Real Power\n</h2>\n\n<p>While the built-in array module works, <strong>NumPy</strong> is the gold standard for numerical arrays in Python. It supports <strong>multi-dimensional arrays</strong>, <strong>vectorized operations</strong>, and a suite of mathematical functions that make data processing faster and easier.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Example:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">numpy</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Output: [2 4 6 8]\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>With NumPy, you can manipulate arrays using just a few lines of code, replacing complex loops and conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 2: Use Vectorized Operations Instead of Loops\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most powerful features of arrays in NumPy is <strong>vectorization</strong>. Instead of writing loops to process data, you can apply operations directly on arrays.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Traditional Loop:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">result</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span><span class=\"p\">)):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">result</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Vectorized Approach:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">result</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only simplifies your code but also significantly boosts performance.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 3: Use Array Slicing for Efficient Data Access\n</h2>\n\n<p>Array slicing allows you to extract or modify subsets of an array easily.<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">40</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">50</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Output: [20 30 40]\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Slicing is efficient because it doesn\u2019t copy the data; it returns a <strong>view</strong>, which is much faster and uses less memory.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 4: Beware of Data Type (dtype) Pitfalls\n</h2>\n\n<p>Arrays are type-specific. Always keep an eye on the <strong><code>dtype</code></strong> of your array, especially when importing or performing operations. A mismatch can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mf\">1.5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">2.5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">3.5</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">dtype</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Output: [1 2 3]\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the decimal part is truncated because we set the data type as integer.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 5: Use Array Functions for Faster Operations\n</h2>\n\n<p>NumPy offers a rich set of built-in functions such as <code>sum()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, <code>max()</code>, <code>min()</code>, and more. These functions are optimized in C and offer superior performance.<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">15</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Output: 12.5\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever possible, rely on these functions instead of writing custom logic.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Tip 6: Master Multi-Dimensional Arrays\n</h2>\n\n<p>Arrays aren\u2019t limited to one dimension.

      "summary": "Armin Ronacher reflects nostalgically on his past contributions to Python and shares insights into how community experiences shape programmers.",
      "summary_original": "This post is addressed to the Python community, one I am glad to be a member of. I\u2019m product of my community. A decade ago I wrote about how much I owed the Python community. Recently I found myself reminiscing again. This year at EuroPython I even gave a brief lightning talk recalling my time in the community \u2014 it made me tear up a little. There were two reasons for this trip down memory lane. First, I had the opportunity to be part of the new Python documentary, which brought back a flood of memories (good and bad). Second, I\u2019ve found myself accidentally pulled towards agentic coding and vibe coders1. Over the last month and a half I have spoken with so many people on AI and programming and realized that a growing number of them are people I might not, in the past, have described as \u201cprogrammers.\u201d Even on the way to the conference I had the pleasure to engage in a multi-hour discussion on the train with an air traffic controller who ventured into programming because of ChatGPT to make his life easier. I\u2019m not sure where I first heard it, but I like the idea that you are what you do. If you\u2019re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter. Consequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you are a programmer. Many people become programmers essentially overnight by picking up one of these tools. Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me might not be receptive to AI and agentic programming. Some of that fear felt warranted: over the last year I saw a number of dismissive posts in my circles about using AI for programming. Yet I have also come to realize that acceptance of AI has shifted significantly. More importantly there is pretty wide support of the notion that newcomers will and should be writing AI-generated code. That matters, because my view is that AI will not lead to fewer programmers. In fact, the opposite seems likely. AI will bring more people into programming than anything else we have done in the last decade. For the Python community in particular, this is a moment to reflect. Python has demonstrated its inclusivity repeatedly \u2014 think of how many people have become successful software engineers through outreach programs (like PyLadies) and community support. I myself can credit much of my early carreer from learning from others on the Python IRC channels. We need to pay close attention to vibe coding. And that not because it might produce lower\u2011quality code, but because if we don\u2019t intentionally welcome the next generation learning through these tools, they will miss out on important lessons many of us learned the hard way. It would be a mistake to treat them as outcasts or \u201cnot real\u201d programmers. Remember that many of our first programs did not have functions, were a mess of GOTO and things copy/pasted together. Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to make ChatGPT build something. Lucky for us: in many of those cases the AI picks Python. We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate an expansion in the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python conference. Yet many of these new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and conferences exist. It\u2019s in the Python community\u2019s interest to find ways to pull them in. Consider this: I can name the person who brought me into Python. But if you were brought in via ChatGPT or a programming agent, there may be no human there \u2014 just the AI. That lack of human connection is, I think, the biggest downside. So we will need to compensate: to reach out, to mentor, to create on\u2011ramps. To instil the idea that you should be looking for a community, because the AI won\u2019t do that. We need to turn a solitary interaction with an AI into a shared journey with a community, and to move them towards learning the important lessons about engineering. We do not want to have a generation of developers held captive by a companies building vibe-coding tools with little incentive for their users to break from those shackles. I\u2019m using vibe coders here as people that give in to having the machine program for them. I believe that many programmers will start in this way before they transition to more traditional software engineering.\u21a9",

      "link": "https://wingware.com/news/2025-07-17",
      "summary": "Wing Python IDE version 11.",
      "summary_original": "Wing Python IDE version 11.0.2 is now available. It improves source code analysis, avoids duplicate evaluations of values in the Watch tool, fixes ruff as an external code checker in the Code Warnings tool, and makes a few other minor improvements. Downloads Be sure to Check for Updates in Wing's Help menu after downloading, to make sure that you have the latest hot fixes. Wing Pro 11.0.1 Wing Personal 11.0.1 Wing 101 11.0.1 Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10 and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing. New in Wing 11Improved AI Assisted DevelopmentWing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate tools AI Coder and AI Chat. AI Coder can be used to write, redesign, or extend code in the current editor. AI Chat can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor. Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider. This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used independently with different AI features. AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing 11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code, commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes. Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed to a revision control system. You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models. For details see AI Assisted Development under Wing Manual in Wing 11's Help menu. Package Management with uv Wing Pro 11 adds support for the uv package manager in the New Project dialog and the Packages tool. For details see Project Manager > Creating Projects > Creating Python Environments and Package Manager > Package Management with uv under Wing Manual in Wing 11's Help menu. Improved Python Code AnalysisWing 11 improves code analysis of literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, typing.Self, type of variables on the def or class line that declares them, generic classes with [...], __all__ in *.pyi files, subscripts in typing.Type and similar, type aliases, and type hints in strings. Updated LocalizationsWing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new User Interface > Include AI Translated Strings preference. Improved diff/mergeWing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges. For details see Difference and Merge under Wing Manual in Wing 11's Help menu. Other Minor Features and ImprovementsWing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a Files > Auto-Save Files When Wing Loses Focus preference, warns immediately when opening a project with an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other bug fixes and usability improvements. Changes and IncompatibilitiesSince Wing 11 replaced the AI tool with AI Coder and AI Chat, and AI configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with Manage AI Providers in the AI menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as the default.

      "link": "https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/",
      "summary": "Seth Braver's \"The Dark Art of Linear Algebra\" offers an accessible introduction to linear algebra for those seeking foundational knowledge in mathematics.",
      "summary_original": "\u201cMathematics is the art of reducing any problem to linear algebra.\u201d \u2014 William Stein If you\u2019ve ever looked at a vector and thought, \u201cJust a column of numbers, right?\u201d, this chapter will change that. The Dark Art of Linear Algebra (aka DALA) by Seth Braver opens with one of the clearest intros I\u2019ve read. Not every part clicks on the first pass, but the effort pays off. Paired with the author\u2019s videos, this is a strong starting point whether you\u2019re learning math for the first time or coming back to it with purpose. As I wrote in Unlocking AI with Math and [Book Notes] Infinitesimals, Derivatives, and Beer \u2013 Full Frontal Calculus (Ch. 1), I\u2019m not learning math to pass a test. I\u2019m learning it to understand the machinery behind AI and robotics, and eventually build machines of my own. (That would be fun, right?) That goal needs a solid grasp of linear algebra. And it starts with understanding what a vector really is. Not just how to work with vectors algebraically, but how they behave in space and fit into a larger structure. This chapter helped me sharpen that understanding. Chapter Notes What\u2019s a Vector? The book makes it clear that the answer to this question will evolve as you go deeper into linear algebra. But Chapter 1 starts simple: a vector is an arrow. A geometric object. A displacement. In the video that comes with the chapter, the author even says to forget everything you think you know about vectors. He introduces them geometrically, which makes them feel tangible and helps you see familiar algebraic ideas in a visual, spatial way. Vector Addition The book introduces vector addition visually. Once you see vectors as displacements or moves through space, the addition feels natural. Almost obvious. Image source: DALA Ch1 The text doesn\u2019t focus on vector subtraction, but there\u2019s an exercise on it. The companion video shows two methods. One of them is subtraction by addition: flip the direction of the vector you want to subtract, then add. It reminded me of that Office scene where Andy says \u201caddition by subtraction,\u201d and Michael asks, \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d In that context, it\u2019s just a throwaway phrase. But in vector math, subtraction by addition is a real method. Flip the vector, then add. If you\u2019ve done engineering, you\u2019ve likely seen this before. Vector addition also follows familiar rules like commutativity and associativity. If those sound fuzzy, the book and video prove them using triangles and parallelograms. No heavy algebra, just geometry. One nice bonus is that the commutative proof gives you another way to add vectors. Place both tails at the same point, draw a parallelogram, and the diagonal gives the sum. Itss clean and easy to visualize: Stretching Vectors Scalar multiplication is introduced as a way to stretch, shrink, or flip a vector, not just multiply its components. The author even explains where the word scalar comes from. Numbers are called scalars because they scale vectors. I liked that he doesn\u2019t assume you already know this. To stretch a vector, multiply by 3. To flip it, multiply by \u20131. To collapse it, multiply by 0. It\u2019s easier to remember when you learn it by drawing instead of just computing. Standard Basis Vectors Only after you\u2019ve built a solid geometric understanding does the author introduce the standard basis vectors: i, j, and k. By then, it\u2019s clear that 2i + 3j + 5k is just a weighted sum of familiar directions. The chapter shows how to express vectors in \u211d\u00b2 and \u211d\u00b3 using these basis vectors, and how to rewrite them in column form. Length of Vectors Be sure to watch the videos that go with this chapter. They walk you through finding the length of a vector visually. You\u2019ll start with the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of a vector in \u211d\u00b3, then extend the idea to \u211d\u207f. The chapter also proves the general length formula when a vector is written in Cartesian coordinates. Neat. The Dot Product The chapter defines the dot product using the same geometric approach as earlier sections, and it makes sense. But for me, it really clicked in the physics example where work is defined using the dot product. The author\u2019s video made it even clearer. In the screenshot above, I underlined \u201cThus we see that work, viewed in a more general setting, is simply a dot product\u201d and scribbled \u201cwatch the video\u201d in the margin. Just a reminder that the video is a great companion to the chapter. The text then walks through key properties: commutativity, dotting a vector with itself, the distributive property, a test for perpendicularity, and how to compute the dot product in \u211d\u00b2. You could memorize the formula. But it\u2019s much more satisfying to understand the parts and derive it from scratch. Like Einstein said, \u201cAny fool can know. The point is to understand.\u201d Here\u2019s a step-by-step derivation, written out in my notes: Thoughts and Tips Like Full Frontal Calculus did for derivatives, this chapter tears vectors down to the basics and builds them back up. It does that visually, intuitively, and from first principles. It starts with geometry, not formulas. By the end, it\u2019s clear that coordinates are just a way to describe vectors. They are not the vectors themselves. Verdict: Highly recommend if you want a clear, visual grasp of what vectors really are. Especially if linear algebra has ever felt abstract, dry, or overly symbolic. If you plan to read the chapter, these tips helped me get the most out of it: Read slowly. Then read slowly again. The material is clear, but it rewards focused attention. Grab a paperback if you can. Write in the margins. Make the book your own. Watch the author\u2019s YouTube videos. The book explains the idea. The video often makes it stick. If you\u2019re reading any of Braver\u2019s math books, don\u2019t skip the videos. They\u2019re short, clear, and worth it. Vectors (from a geometric perspective) The Dot Product (from a geometric perspective) Don\u2019t worry about the proofs. They\u2019re explained in plain language, supported by visuals, and still rigorous. You don\u2019t need a separate book on how to follow them. They just make sense. Brush up on your trig. Knowing how cosine works pays off when finding angles between vectors. It\u2019s a small part of the chapter, but if you\u2019re rusty, check out the trig section in Precalculus Made Difficult by the same author. Do the exercises. The book includes answers, which makes it great for self-study. But like in Full Frontal Calculus, the solutions are compact. Use ChatGPT or Grok (xAI) to expand on them when needed. Use spaced repetition. For ideas that are hard to keep in memory, try active recall. I use Anki, but any similar tool should work. Check out the book sample. The author offers a sample on his site. If you\u2019re on the fence, it gives you a solid feel for the writing and style. These pages and videos are exactly what I wish I had the first time I saw vectors. They make the concept click and give you a foundation you can build on, whether you\u2019re starting fresh or coming back to review. More to come. Stay tuned.

Not every part clicks on the first pass, but the effort pays off.

I&#8217;m learning it to understand the machinery behind <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> and robotics, and eventually build machines of my own. (That would be fun,&nbsp;right?)</p>\n<p><br />\nThat goal needs a solid grasp of linear algebra. And it starts with understanding what a vector really is. Not just how to work with vectors algebraically, but how they behave in space and fit into a larger&nbsp;structure.</p>\n<p>This chapter helped me sharpen that&nbsp;understanding.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-notes\">Chapter&nbsp;Notes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"whats-a-vector\">What\u2019s a&nbsp;Vector?</h3>\n<p>The book makes it clear that the answer to this question will evolve as you go deeper into linear algebra. But Chapter 1 starts simple: a vector is an arrow. A geometric object. A&nbsp;displacement.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"244px\" src=\"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/dala_ch1_vector_v_print.webp\" width=\"244px\" /></p>\n<p>In the video that comes with the chapter, the author even says to forget everything you think you know about vectors. He introduces them geometrically, which makes them feel tangible and helps you see familiar algebraic ideas in a visual, spatial&nbsp;way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vector-addition\">Vector&nbsp;Addition</h3>\n<p>The book introduces vector addition visually. Once you see vectors as displacements or moves through space, the addition feels natural. Almost&nbsp;obvious.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/dala_ch1_vector_addition.webp\" />\n<em>Image source: <span class=\"caps\">DALA</span>&nbsp;Ch1</em></p>\n<p>The text doesn&#8217;t focus on vector subtraction, but there&#8217;s an exercise on it. The companion video shows two methods. One of them is subtraction by addition: flip the direction of the vector you want to subtract, then add. It reminded me of that <em>Office</em> scene where Andy says &#8220;addition by subtraction,&#8221; and Michael asks, &#8220;What does that even mean?&#8221; In that context, it&#8217;s just a throwaway phrase. But in vector math, subtraction by addition is a real method. Flip the vector, then add. If you&#8217;ve done engineering, you\u2019ve likely seen this&nbsp;before.</p>\n<p>Vector addition also follows familiar rules like <em>commutativity</em> and <em>associativity</em>. If those sound fuzzy, the book and video prove them using triangles and parallelograms. No heavy algebra, just&nbsp;geometry.</p>\n<p>One nice bonus is that the commutative proof gives you another way to add vectors. Place both tails at the same point, draw a parallelogram, and the diagonal gives the sum. Itss clean and easy to&nbsp;visualize:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"253px\" src=\"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/dala_ch1_vector_commut.webp\" width=\"534px\" /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3 id=\"stretching-vectors\">Stretching&nbsp;Vectors</h3>\n<p>Scalar multiplication is introduced as a way to stretch, shrink, or flip a vector, not just multiply its&nbsp;components.</p>\n<p>The author even explains where the word scalar comes from. Numbers are called scalars because they scale vectors. I liked that he doesn&#8217;t assume you already know&nbsp;this.</p>\n<p>To stretch a vector, multiply by&nbsp;3.</p>\n<p>To flip it, multiply by&nbsp;\u20131.</p>\n<p>To collapse it, multiply by&nbsp;0.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easier to remember when you learn it by drawing instead of just&nbsp;computing.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3 id=\"standard-basis-vectors\">Standard Basis&nbsp;Vectors</h3>\n<p>Only after you\u2019ve built a solid geometric understanding does the author introduce the standard basis vectors: <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, and <strong>k</strong>. By then, it&#8217;s clear that 2<strong>i</strong> + 3<strong>j</strong> + 5<strong>k</strong> is just a weighted sum of familiar&nbsp;directions.</p>\n<p>The chapter shows how to express vectors in \u211d\u00b2 and \u211d\u00b3 using these basis vectors, and how to rewrite them in column&nbsp;form.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3 id=\"length-of-vectors\">Length of&nbsp;Vectors</h3>\n<p>Be sure to watch the videos that go with this chapter. They walk you through finding the length of a vector&nbsp;visually.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll start with the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of a vector in \u211d\u00b3, then extend the idea to \u211d\u207f. The chapter also proves the general length formula when a vector is written in Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp;Neat.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-dot-product\">The Dot&nbsp;Product</h3>\n<p>The chapter defines the dot product using the same geometric approach as earlier sections, and it makes sense. But for me, it really clicked in the physics example where work is defined using the dot product. The author\u2019s video made it even&nbsp;clearer.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/dala_ch1_dotprod_work.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><br />\nIn the screenshot above, I underlined &#8220;Thus we see that work, viewed in a more general setting, is simply a dot product&#8221; and scribbled &#8220;watch the video&#8221; in the margin. Just a reminder that the video is a great companion to the&nbsp;chapter.</p>\n<p>The text then walks through key properties: commutativity, dotting a vector with itself, the distributive property, a test for perpendicularity, and how to compute the dot product in&nbsp;\u211d\u00b2.</p>\n<p>You could memorize the formula. But it&#8217;s much more satisfying to understand the parts and derive it from scratch. Like Einstein said, &#8220;Any fool can know. The point is to&nbsp;understand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step derivation, written out in my&nbsp;notes:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"501px\" src=\"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb06/dala_ch1_dotprod_deriv.jpg\" width=\"728px\" /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-and-tips\">Thoughts and&nbsp;Tips</h2>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://newsletter.ruslanspivak.com/p/book-notes-infinitesimals-derivatives\">Full Frontal Calculus</a> did for derivatives, this chapter tears vectors down to the basics and builds them back up. It does that visually, intuitively, and from first principles. It starts with geometry, not formulas. By the end, it\u2019s clear that coordinates are just a way to describe vectors. They are not the vectors&nbsp;themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Highly recommend if you want a clear, visual grasp of what vectors really are.

      "summary": "The Python Language Summit addressed concurrency concepts and potential data race issues in free-threaded programming.",
      "summary_original": "Tobias Wrigstad, Matthew Parkinson, and Fridtjof Stoldt attended their first Python Language Summit to talk about some new concurrency concepts with core developers. Their slides have great diagrams, so I recommend checking them out. Tobias delivered the presentation to core developers, opening with a \u201cpotentially contentious statement\u201d that \u201c[data races and concurrency bugs] were the future that free-threaded Python programmers would see if free-threading was adopted for Python programs\u201d.\u201cOff to the data races!\u201dThe issue is when a value, such as \u201cA\u201d in the above diagram, is shared across multiple threads and written concurrently. \u201cThere is no easy way to tell when an object is shared. In the worst case, you have to read the whole program\u201d.These data-race bugs are also difficult to resolve using existing tools like \u201cChatGPT or StackOverflow,\u201d which are only able to solve \u201csyntax-driven problems,\u201d and only after drawing the object graph do we see problems. Tools like ThreadSanitizer (TSan) can help, \u201cbut you first need to understand that you need to use a tool\u201d. \u201cAs a Python programmer, I\u2019m assuming this is not in your typical toolchain\u201d.Tobias continued, \u201cThe PEP 703 work has shown that it\u2019s costly for the runtime to protect itself against racing code. Can we lift this problem up and talk about this problem at the Python level and make Python data-race free? Can we get an exception instead of a race?\u201dDeep ImmutabilityReferencing the \u201cfreezing\u201d proposal that Mark Shannon had spoken about just hours ago in his Language Summit talk \u201cAn Uncontentious Talk about Contention\u201d, \u201cdeep immutability\u201d is one option for resolving data races in Python. Some performance improvements could be gained by adopting this model.This model makes \u201call shared data immutable\u201d so \u201cthere can be no data races\u201d and is \u201ctrivial to check at runtime\u201d. However, to do so would require sacrificing mutability, which is \u201ccommon in Python programs\u201d. \u201cMore immutability is great, but it\u2019s not a solution to all our problems.\u201dRust\u2019s ownership model\u201cIf we squint a little bit, we can explain Rust\u2019s ownership model as \u2018objects with a reference count greater than 1 cannot be mutated\u2019\u201d, Tobias explained. Rust\u2019s ownership model allows for mutable objects as long as an object isn\u2019t referenced more than once.Adopting Rust\u2019s model would require a \u201cmove operator\u201d which, when used, \u201ctorches the original reference\u201d and moves the reference to a new owner. This operator provides a safe transfer of mutable objects when a reference count is exactly 1.However, \u201cthe same rule that prevents Y being assigned to X prevents nice things that people like to do\u201d. This approach would \u201cmassively restrict which object graphs are valid\u201d and \u201cmany Python object graphs in practice don\u2019t look like this\u201d, instead usually containing \u201creference loops\u201d. Adopting the Rust ownership model in Python would \u201crequire rewriting most existing Python programs\u201d.Region-based ownership modelThe group proposed instead a \u201cregion-based model\u201d they had designed called \u201cLungfish\u201d that is \u201cmore permissive than Rust\u2019s data model\u201d but is \u201cstill data-race free\u201d. Regions are \u201cnamespaces for data\u201d. Regions are a group of mutable objects that are isolated from the outside, and all contained objects are shared, transferred, or frozen altogether. Regions can be nested within other regions, too.Can\u2019t move Region \u201cr\u201d to thread \u201c2\u201d because the borrow count is not 1.Regions are \u201can enclosure of objects\u201d that is tracked by their \u201cborrow count\u201d, which is the number of references that are \u201cpointing into a region\u201d. Objects are \u201cslurped\u201d (technical term) into a Region, and the borrow count increases for each reference pointing into the region. Regions can only be \u201cmoved\u201d when the borrow count is 1, and any moves that don\u2019t have a borrow count of 1 indicate a data race and should raise an exception.Threads 1 and 2 share region r, where thread 1 holds the lock with access to the referenced region r, and has two references from X to A and Z to 42. Hence, the borrow count of 3.Another option is to share the ownership of a region between two or more threads. Doing so would \u201cmove the ownership of the region within a lock shared between threads\u201d. \u201cWhen a thread owns the lock, then that thread can create points within the region and access the data, and the borrow count increments\u201d. This borrow count increment needs to happen to track when the thread can release the lock safely, meaning there are the correct number of references to objects within the region.What\u2019s next for Lungfish and \u201cFearless Python\u201d?The group has a plan to introduce Lungfish and its concepts to Python through a \u201cseries of four Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)\u201d. The order and current status of each PEP is the following:The first PEP is for \u201cdeep immutability\u201d and was \u201calmost finished with 99% of tests passing on Python 3.12\u201d. The team plans to upgrade to 3.13 and then submit the PEP.The second PEP would propose \u201ccyclic immutable garbage with reference counting\u201d and also \u201cadding atomic reference counting for the new immutable objects\u201d. This PEP is around 80% done.The third PEP would be for \u201csharing immutable data between threads and subinterpreters (PEP 734). Tobias added that \u201csubinterpreters can be a good delivery model for some concurrency model on top of [subinterpreters]\u201d. This PEP and project are around 50% done.The fourth PEP would add sharing mutable data between threads and subinterpreters using Regions.Tobias closed by sharing why the project was named \u201cLungfish\u201d: \u201cthe project can be used with or without GIL(s)\u201d (pronounced \u201cgills\u201d), which was received with equal parts laughter and groans at the pun.DiscussionBarry Warsaw asked, \u201cWould regions be a first-class data object in Python? Tobias answered \u201cyes\u201d, the proposal included a \u201cRegion()\u201d object that can be assigned names like so:r = Region()r.f = 42Thomas Wouters wondered \u201cwhether regions would get used ubiquitously\u201d, asking \u201cwhich region does the sys module live in?\u201d as a particularly difficult example. The group answered that they \u201care not sure what the answer is\u201d and that there \u201care some concurrency issues there\u201d and \u201cthat you want [the sys module] to be in a REPL thread\u201d. \u201cPeople in this room probably have better ideas here\u201d.David Hewitt, maintainer of the Rust PyO3 project, contrasted the proposed Region object with Rust\u2019s \u201cmutex\u201d type and Python\u2019s \u201cLock\u201d type. Python\u2019s Lock type doesn\u2019t protect any data inside the lock, whereas Rust\u2019s mutex type does protect data within the mutex. Rust\u2019s mutex allows taking the data out of the mutex if you own the mutex, changing the mutability, and more, similar to Regions. David \u201chas become familiar with the mutexes in Rust, and coming back to Python\u2019s locks feels like a bit of a paper cut\u201d.David asked whether, instead of \u201cintroducing a new concept with Regions,\u201d the three would introduce the concept more similar to a Rust mutex instead. Tobias answered that the protection mirrors the mutex, but that Regions uniquely allow nesting \u201cto build a tree of regions\u201d and a \u201cnotion of transitive closure of state in the object graph\u201d that \u201ctranscends its use within a mutex, such as when the region is transferred or how freezing propagates within a region\u201d. \u201cMutexes are one use of a Region, but not the only use\u201d.Donghee Na asked about the stability of existing behavior. Fridtjof answered that the three \u201chad added tests specifically for the new behavior of immutability\u201d, saying that the \u201cimmutability and freezing feature branches are really solid\u201d and that the region feature branch is \u201cmore experimental\u201d.Donghee continued and asked whether the community would need to modify its code. Tobias answered, \u201cYes, if they want to take advantage of the benefits\u201d. Matthew answered, \u201cPure Python can directly support regions, if you have a C library, then you\u2019d need to add some modifications to your code to benefit\u201d.\u201cC libraries would be an opt-in model at the module level\u201d. This is similar to free-threading, where modules need to opt in; otherwise, the runtime doesn\u2019t run with free-threading. \u201cWhen you freeze an object graph, if [the runtime] encountered an object that doesn\u2019t implement freezing, then you backtrack the freezing\u201d. \u201cYou would need to register your types as freezeable\u201d.Martin DeMello asked whether freezing a region was a \u201cone-way operation,\u201d noting that freezing a region removes the object graph. Tobias answered that at the moment, \u201cit does not allow [frozen objects] to be mutated until [the frozen objects] hit the finalizer, which turns objects back to be mutable again\u201d. \u201cWe could do something like you\u2019re proposing, I\u2019m just worried,\u201d with laughter at the mention of the finalizer. Tobias added a comment about \u201ca potential copy-on-write\u201d type to allow users to enable this use case.Pablo Galindo Salgado asked about C extensions, \u201cIf I incref (increase a reference count), how does the region know whether this is an internal reference or an external reference?\u201d Fridtjof replied that \u201cthere are two answers\u201d, first being that \u201cif the C extension had opted in, the system assumes that [the C extension author] is doing the right things\u201d which in Pablo\u2019s case would require a PyRegion_IncRef() function or similar. The second answer is that if the C extension doesn\u2019t opt in, the system would be able to \u201creestablish the borrow count\u201d for \u201cbackwards compatibility\u201d by \u201cleveraging the garbage collection mechanism that\u2019s already there\u201d.Overall, there was definitely interest in the trio\u2019s proposal from core developers due to the new problems that free-threaded Python will bring to Python users regarding concurrency.",

Python\u2019s Lock type doesn\u2019t protect any data inside the lock, whereas Rust\u2019s mutex type does protect data within the mutex. Rust\u2019s mutex allows taking the data out of the mutex if you own the mutex, changing the mutability, and more, similar to Regions. David \u201chas become familiar with the mutexes in Rust, and coming back to Python\u2019s locks feels like a bit of a paper cut\u201d.</p><p>David asked whether, instead of \u201cintroducing a new concept with Regions,\u201d the three would introduce the concept more similar to a Rust mutex instead. Tobias answered that the protection mirrors the mutex, but that Regions uniquely allow nesting \u201cto build a tree of regions\u201d and a \u201cnotion of transitive closure of state in the object graph\u201d that \u201ctranscends its use within a mutex, such as when the region is transferred or how freezing propagates within a region\u201d. \u201cMutexes are one use of a Region, but not the only use\u201d.</p><p>Donghee Na asked about the stability of existing behavior. Fridtjof answered that the three \u201chad added tests specifically for the new behavior of immutability\u201d, saying that the \u201cimmutability and freezing feature branches are really solid\u201d and that the region feature branch is \u201cmore experimental\u201d.</p><p>Donghee continued and asked whether the community would need to modify its code. Tobias answered, \u201cYes, if they want to take advantage of the benefits\u201d. Matthew answered, \u201cPure Python can directly support regions, if you have a C library, then you\u2019d need to add some modifications to your code to benefit\u201d.</p><p>\u201cC libraries would be an opt-in model at the module level\u201d. This is similar to free-threading, where modules need to opt in; otherwise, the runtime doesn\u2019t run with free-threading. \u201cWhen you freeze an object graph, if [the runtime] encountered an object that doesn\u2019t implement freezing, then you backtrack the freezing\u201d. \u201cYou would need to register your types as freezeable\u201d.</p><p>Martin DeMello asked whether freezing a region was a \u201cone-way operation,\u201d noting that freezing a region removes the object graph. Tobias answered that at the moment, \u201cit does not allow [frozen objects] to be mutated until [the frozen objects] hit the finalizer, which turns objects back to be mutable again\u201d. \u201cWe could do something like you\u2019re proposing, I\u2019m just worried,\u201d with laughter at the mention of the finalizer. Tobias added a comment about \u201ca potential copy-on-write\u201d type to allow users to enable this use case.</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado asked about C extensions, \u201cIf I incref (increase a reference count), how does the region know whether this is an internal reference or an external reference?\u201d Fridtjof replied that \u201cthere are two answers\u201d, first being that \u201cif the C extension had opted in, the system assumes that [the C extension author] is doing the right things\u201d which in Pablo\u2019s case would require a <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyRegion_IncRef()</span> function or similar. The second answer is that if the C extension doesn\u2019t opt in, the system would be able to \u201creestablish the borrow count\u201d for \u201cbackwards compatibility\u201d by \u201cleveraging the garbage collection mechanism that\u2019s already there\u201d.</p><p>Overall, there was definitely interest in the trio\u2019s proposal from core developers due to the new problems that free-threaded Python will bring to Python users regarding concurrency.</p><div><br /></div>",

Tobias delivered the presentation to core developers, opening with a \u201cpotentially contentious statement\u201d that \u201c[data races and concurrency bugs] were the future that free-threaded Python programmers would see if free-threading was adopted for Python programs\u201d.</p><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-gHIfPZi4EIA1RJnTrUOrDkWemTs9Vdb0dwGUoC90Ty4DO9iSDb_WX38A8LDg_9_D_pDRMMNKyuSmNfB3ERBG5yzwjHboTUQnmBtWmuul0kfXytagG8ManMR3l2O8ZeJcMvUtS-UghM_Jd-D6nM0LUhne4vg4Z5RDmkGxqw8kDRrPw2SaVQ/s1279/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2008-54-46.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-gHIfPZi4EIA1RJnTrUOrDkWemTs9Vdb0dwGUoC90Ty4DO9iSDb_WX38A8LDg_9_D_pDRMMNKyuSmNfB3ERBG5yzwjHboTUQnmBtWmuul0kfXytagG8ManMR3l2O8ZeJcMvUtS-UghM_Jd-D6nM0LUhne4vg4Z5RDmkGxqw8kDRrPw2SaVQ/s320/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2008-54-46.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cOff to the data races!\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The issue is when a value, such as \u201cA\u201d in the above diagram, is shared across multiple threads and written concurrently. \u201cThere is no easy way to tell when an object is shared. In the worst case, you have to read the whole program\u201d.</p><p>These data-race bugs are also difficult to resolve using existing tools like \u201cChatGPT or StackOverflow,\u201d which are only able to solve \u201csyntax-driven problems,\u201d and only after drawing the object graph do we see problems. Tools like ThreadSanitizer (TSan) can help, \u201cbut you first need to understand that you need to use a tool\u201d. \u201cAs a Python programmer, I\u2019m assuming this is not in your typical toolchain\u201d.</p><p>Tobias continued, \u201cThe PEP 703 work has shown that it\u2019s costly for the runtime to protect itself against racing code. Can we lift this problem up and talk about this problem at the Python level and make Python data-race free? Can we get an exception instead of a race?\u201d</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Deep Immutability</h2><p>Referencing the \u201cfreezing\u201d proposal that Mark Shannon had spoken about just hours ago in his Language Summit talk \u201cAn Uncontentious Talk about Contention\u201d, \u201cdeep immutability\u201d is one option for resolving data races in Python. Some performance improvements could be gained by adopting this model.</p><p>This model makes \u201call shared data immutable\u201d so \u201cthere can be no data races\u201d and is \u201ctrivial to check at runtime\u201d. However, to do so would require sacrificing mutability, which is \u201ccommon in Python programs\u201d. \u201cMore immutability is great, but it\u2019s not a solution to all our problems.\u201d</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Rust\u2019s ownership model</h2><p>\u201cIf we squint a little bit, we can explain Rust\u2019s ownership model as \u2018objects with a reference count greater than 1 cannot be mutated\u2019\u201d, Tobias explained. Rust\u2019s ownership model allows for mutable objects as long as an object isn\u2019t referenced more than once.</p><p>Adopting Rust\u2019s model would require a \u201cmove operator\u201d which, when used, \u201ctorches the original reference\u201d and moves the reference to a new owner. This operator provides a safe transfer of mutable objects when a reference count is exactly 1.</p><p>However, \u201cthe same rule that prevents Y being assigned to X prevents nice things that people like to do\u201d. This approach would \u201cmassively restrict which object graphs are valid\u201d and \u201cmany Python object graphs in practice don\u2019t look like this\u201d, instead usually containing \u201creference loops\u201d. Adopting the Rust ownership model in Python would \u201crequire rewriting most existing Python programs\u201d.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Region-based ownership model</h2><p>The group proposed instead a \u201cregion-based model\u201d they had designed called \u201cLungfish\u201d that is \u201cmore permissive than Rust\u2019s data model\u201d but is \u201cstill data-race free\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Regions are \u201cnamespaces for data\u201d.

Matthew answered, \u201cPure Python can directly support regions, if you have a C library, then you\u2019d need to add some modifications to your code to benefit\u201d.</p><p>\u201cC libraries would be an opt-in model at the module level\u201d. This is similar to free-threading, where modules need to opt in; otherwise, the runtime doesn\u2019t run with free-threading. \u201cWhen you freeze an object graph, if [the runtime] encountered an object that doesn\u2019t implement freezing, then you backtrack the freezing\u201d. \u201cYou would need to register your types as freezeable\u201d.</p><p>Martin DeMello asked whether freezing a region was a \u201cone-way operation,\u201d noting that freezing a region removes the object graph. Tobias answered that at the moment, \u201cit does not allow [frozen objects] to be mutated until [the frozen objects] hit the finalizer, which turns objects back to be mutable again\u201d. \u201cWe could do something like you\u2019re proposing, I\u2019m just worried,\u201d with laughter at the mention of the finalizer. Tobias added a comment about \u201ca potential copy-on-write\u201d type to allow users to enable this use case.</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado asked about C extensions, \u201cIf I incref (increase a reference count), how does the region know whether this is an internal reference or an external reference?\u201d Fridtjof replied that \u201cthere are two answers\u201d, first being that \u201cif the C extension had opted in, the system assumes that [the C extension author] is doing the right things\u201d which in Pablo\u2019s case would require a <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyRegion_IncRef()</span> function or similar. The second answer is that if the C extension doesn\u2019t opt in, the system would be able to \u201creestablish the borrow count\u201d for \u201cbackwards compatibility\u201d by \u201cleveraging the garbage collection mechanism that\u2019s already there\u201d.</p><p>Overall, there was definitely interest in the trio\u2019s proposal from core developers due to the new problems that free-threaded Python will bring to Python users regarding concurrency.</p><div><br /></div>"

      "summary_original": "In memoriam: Michael FoordLarry Hastings led a moment of silence to remember former core developer Michael Foord, who passed away earlier this year. Michael was known for many things, including \u201cstarting the tradition of having the Language Summit events at PyCon\u201d. You can read the memorial for Michael Foord on discuss.python.org.Pluggable JITsThe first lightning talk was delivered by Martin DeMello from Meta. Martin works on the Cinder Just-in-Time compiler (JIT) at Meta which is \u201cone of two Python JITs\u201d. Martin asks whether there is room for alternative or \u201cpluggable\u201d JITs and envisions a future where a JIT would be pip-installable, a-la \u201cpip install jit\u201d.To be able to build pluggable JITs, the CPython project would need to provide three things:PyAPI_UnstableFunc()PyEval_EvalFrameJIT()User-defined opcodesThis would avoid the need for other projects like Cinder to copy substantial amounts of CPython code or fork CPython to provide a JIT. JITs need publicly linkable access to low-level functions. Martin has received \u201cpushback\u201d for this sort of API access, but said that \u201cif the social contract is that you have to keep up with language features yourself this would be enough for JIT use\u201d.Opcodes are a \u201csmall namespace\u201d of only 255 values, so \u201cone opcode could be provided for user opcodes and require opargs unpacking\u201d to avoid forking the Python interpreter. The PyEval_EvalFrameJIT() API would be used instead of PyEval_EvalFrame() when a pluggable JIT was used to allow the custom JIT to evaluate frames. See PEP 523 for more information about Python\u2019s current JIT.Virtual Threads from JavaMark Shannon asked, \u201cDid Java get threads right?\u201d Mark recently opened a thread on Python Discourse about adding Virtual Threads to Python. Virtual threads are \u201clike green threads\u201d in Java and are built on delimited continuations. Java uses \u201cstackful symmetric\u201d coroutines compared to Python\u2019s \u201cstackless asymmetric coroutines\u201d. Stackful means that code can yield from deep within the call stack, meaning that code avoids the \u201cWhat color is your function?\u201d problem.Mark shared a demo that started, briefly ran, and stopped over a million virtual threads, which \u201cif you had been using system threads would have crashed your VM\u201d. Virtual threads are a \u201cbit heavier weight than coroutines\u201d, but might be worth it for the benefits. \u201cThreads don\u2019t scale very well in free-threading\u201d, where if virtual threads are combined with system threads, programs can get better performance. Mark encouraged others to take a look at the proposal on Discourse.Null Coalescing Operators \u201c??\u201dNoah Kim proposed adding \u201cnull coalescing operators\u201d to Python. Earlier in 2025, Noah opened a thread on discuss.python.org about reviving PEP 505. Instead of \u201cnull\u201d, the operators would be \u201cNone\u2019-aware. The three operators being proposed are:None-aware access \u201c?.\u201dNone-aware comparison \u201c??\u201dNone-aware assignment \u201c??=\u201dNoah shared an example of using each operator. None-aware access is useful for regular expressions to \u201cconcisely emulate \u2018if is None\u2019 behavior into a single line\u201d:re.fullmatch(\u201cpat\u201d)?.span() == (0, 6)Defaults using None can be improved using None-aware comparison and assignment:headers = headers ?? {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}headers ??= {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}Compared to:if headers is None: headers = {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}Noah shared a potential future for a Python that \u201cbuilds on none-ness as a core feature\u201d, such as adding .first() and .last() methods to lists when combined with none-aware operators for simpler and more correct code.Generative AI tooling vibe checkGregory Smith wanted to get a general vibe-check on AI auto-completion use within an integrated development environment to work on open source software. A rough count of hands in the room showed around half of the folks had used AI autocompletion, and between a third and a quarter of people had used \u201cagentic\u201d AI for open source work. \u201cCPython is a very old codebase,\u201d and some modules are \u201cridiculous for humans to understand,\u201d like the Unicode module. Greg recommended core developers to try out some of the new tools and said, \u201cThe upcoming year will be intense in terms of what can be done with the tools\u201d.Carol Willing shared that she had used and paid for a tool called \u201cCodeVis\u201d. Despite being \u201cearly days\u201d, the tool lets you ask questions about a codebase. \u201cGood for exploring codebases you don\u2019t know\u201d. Greg agreed, saying that the tools \u201ccan tell you where to go to make changes\u201d. \u201cNone of us understand the entire [CPython] codebase. These tools are helpful when plugging into another place you\u2019re not used to\u201d.Greg is \u201ccoordinating with the Python Software Foundation\u201d on making these AI tools available for interested core developers.Is \u201cworse is better\u201d still better?The creator of the Python programming language, Guido van Rossum, was next up and asked, \u201cIs \u2018worse is better\u2019 still better\u201d? Guido conceded that this was \u201cmore a rant than a proposal\u201d to \u201cget core developers thinking\u201d. Guido started by recounting earlier periods of Python development from 35 years ago, where he used UNIX \u201calmost exclusively\u201d and thus \u201cPython was greatly influenced by UNIX\u2019s \u2018worse is better\u2019 philosophy\u201d.\u201cFor Python, \u2018worse is better\u2019 has served me really well for a long time\u201d, especially when Guido was writing most of the code. Guido shared many of the ways that early Python versions were \u201cworse\u201d than what we have today, such as no long integers, being built on top of C stdio, not having classes, etc.These limitations meant that Guido could \u201cget something working in 3 months\u201d. \u201cEven in the language definition, I didn\u2019t think hard about many design issues, I copied what I found in C and ABC, Python\u2019s predecessor\u201d.\u201cOver the years, every single thing where I took a shortcut was eventually fixed\u201d. Dictionary hashing had been \u201crewritten twice\u201d, \u201cwe have garbage collectors up the wazoo\u201d, and \u201cnow we have a lot of tests. At the time we had no tests\u201d shared Guido with chuckles from core developers.\u201cIn those times, \u2018worse is better\u2019 was key to getting the language accepted. I couldn\u2019t afford to work 3 years on language design without user feedback or endorphins from people giving me kudos\u201d. The initial release of Python happened less than a year after its development began, and \u201cnone of the issues were fixed, except classes,\u201d which \u201cwere added by an intern\u201d.\u201cThe fact that [Python] wasn\u2019t perfect encouraged many people to start contributing. All of the code was straightforward, there were no thoughts of optimization\u201d. \u201cThese early contributors also now had a stake in the language; [Python] was also their baby\u201d. Guido shared that many of these contributors began advocating for Python within their individual places of work.\u201cDoes \u2018worse is better\u2019 still have a role today?\u201d Guido contrasted early development to how Python is developed now: \u201cfeatures that take years to produce from teams of software developers paid by big tech companies. The static type system requires an academic-level understanding of esoteric type system features.\u201d And this isn\u2019t just Python the language, \u201cthird-party projects like numpy are maintained by folks who are paid full-time to do so\u201d.\u201cNow we have a huge community, but very few people, relatively speaking, are contributing meaningfully.\u201d Guido asked whether the expectation for Python contributors going forward would be that \u201cyou had to write a perfect PEP or create a perfect prototype that can be turned into production-ready code?\u201d Guido opined for the \u201cold days\u201d where feature development could skip performance or feature-completion to get something into the hands of the community to \u201cstart kicking the tires\u201d.\u201cDo we have to abandon \u2018worse is better\u2019 as a philosophy and try to make everything as perfect as possible?\u201d Guido thought doing so \u201cwould be a shame\u201d, but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure how to change it\u201d, acknowledging that core developers wouldn\u2019t want to create features and then break users with future releases.Guido referenced David Hewitt\u2019s PyO3 talk about Rust and Python, and that development \u201cwas using worse is better,\u201d where there is a core feature set that works, and plenty of work to be done and open questions. \u201cThat sounds a lot more fun than working on core CPython\u201d, Guido paused, \u201c...not that I\u2019d ever personally learn Rust. Maybe I should give it a try after,\u201d which garnered laughter from core developers.\u201cMaybe we should do more of that: allowing contributors in the community to have a stake and care\u201d.Let\u2019s benchmark memory as wellPablo Galindo Salgado, who is the maintainer of the Python profiler Memray, asserts that CPython should \u201calso benchmark memory\u201d. Execution speeds like \u201c10% faster\u201d, \u201cdominate benchmarks\u201d, but memory is \u201ckinda important as well, especially because we\u2019re doing big changes\u201d and \u201c[Python] is flying blind right now\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019re measuring resident size of memory,\u201d which is kinda like \u201cone eye is blind\u201d. Resident memory doesn\u2019t show when the actual allocation is happening. Pablo also showed that resident memory can be affected by other programs running on your computer. For example, Pablo\u2019s MacBook would non-deterministically move a large allocation of memory to \u201cswap\u201d after sleeping for long periods of time, and this would affect the resident memory graph.Pablo shared other views into memory available on Linux, such as \u201cworking set memory\u201d, showing the memory that your program is \u201ctouching\u201d, and showing memory that is allocated but not being used. \u201cCurrently, we can\u2019t use these types of memory, we only have one number, [resident memory] today\u201d.\u201cMemory has become an afterthought, we are focusing too much on speed. Regressions in memory are usually accidental\u201d. Pablo proposed memory.python.org or reusing performance infrastructure, and for the Python core developer team to create some memory-focused benchmarks.T-strings brain dumpLysandros Nikolaou gave \u201cless a lightning talk\u201d and \u201cmore a brain dump\u201d. Lysandros showed off T-strings (PEP 750) and shared that an issue was opened asking to make Templates and Interpolation types Generic. Lysandros wondered if this was the correct approach or whether core developers needed to \u201cthink about the type system in general in a different way\u201d. He didn\u2019t think \u201cany of the choices presented are good enough\u201d for \u201cpeople building DSLs or combining static analysis and parsing DSLs with runtime information on types\u201d.Lysandros closed by asking core developers to \u201cthink about how the type system will evolve under the unique possibilities that T-strings allow or whether the status quo is enough\u201d.",

Maybe I should give it a try after,\u201d which garnered laughter from core developers.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should do more of that: allowing contributors in the community to have a stake and care\u201d.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Let\u2019s benchmark memory as well</h2><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, who is the maintainer of the <a href=\"https://github.com/bloomberg/memray\">Python profiler Memray</a>, asserts that CPython should \u201calso benchmark memory\u201d. Execution speeds like \u201c10% faster\u201d, \u201cdominate benchmarks\u201d, but memory is \u201ckinda important as well, especially because we\u2019re doing big changes\u201d and \u201c[Python] is flying blind right now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re measuring resident size of memory,\u201d which is kinda like \u201cone eye is blind\u201d. Resident memory doesn\u2019t show when the actual allocation is happening. Pablo also showed that resident memory can be affected by other programs running on your computer. For example, Pablo\u2019s MacBook would non-deterministically move a large allocation of memory to \u201cswap\u201d after sleeping for long periods of time, and this would affect the resident memory graph.</p><p>Pablo shared other views into memory available on Linux, such as \u201cworking set memory\u201d, showing the memory that your program is \u201ctouching\u201d, and showing memory that is allocated but not being used. \u201cCurrently, we can\u2019t use these types of memory, we only have one number, [resident memory] today\u201d.</p><p>\u201cMemory has become an afterthought, we are focusing too much on speed.

Michael was known for many things, including \u201cstarting the tradition of having the Language Summit events at PyCon\u201d. You can <a href=\"http://discuss.python.org\">read the memorial for Michael Foord on discuss.python.org</a>.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Pluggable JITs</h2><p>The first lightning talk was delivered by Martin DeMello from Meta. Martin works on the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder\">Cinder Just-in-Time compiler</a> (JIT) at Meta which is \u201cone of two Python JITs\u201d. Martin asks whether there is room for alternative or \u201cpluggable\u201d JITs and envisions a future where a JIT would be pip-installable, a-la \u201cpip install jit\u201d.</p><p>To be able to build pluggable JITs, the CPython project would need to provide three things:</p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyAPI_UnstableFunc()</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyEval_EvalFrameJIT()</span></li><li>User-defined opcodes</li></ul><p></p><p>This would avoid the need for other projects like Cinder to copy substantial amounts of CPython code or fork CPython to provide a JIT. JITs need publicly linkable access to low-level functions. Martin has received \u201cpushback\u201d for this sort of API access, but said that \u201cif the social contract is that you have to keep up with language features yourself this would be enough for JIT use\u201d.</p><p>Opcodes are a \u201csmall namespace\u201d of only 255 values, so \u201cone opcode could be provided for user opcodes and require opargs unpacking\u201d to avoid forking the Python interpreter. The <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyEval_EvalFrameJIT()</span> API would be used instead of <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">PyEval_EvalFrame()</span> when a pluggable JIT was used to allow the custom JIT to evaluate frames. See <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0523/\">PEP 523</a> for more information about Python\u2019s current JIT.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Virtual Threads from Java</h2><p>Mark Shannon asked, \u201cDid Java get threads right?\u201d Mark recently opened a <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/add-virtual-threads-to-python/91403\">thread on Python Discourse</a> about adding Virtual Threads to Python. Virtual threads are \u201clike green threads\u201d in Java and are built on delimited continuations. Java uses \u201cstackful symmetric\u201d coroutines compared to Python\u2019s \u201cstackless asymmetric coroutines\u201d. Stackful means that code can yield from deep within the call stack, meaning that code avoids the \u201c<a href=\"https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/\">What color is your function?</a>\u201d problem.</p><p>Mark shared a demo that started, briefly ran, and stopped over a million virtual threads, which \u201cif you had been using system threads would have crashed your VM\u201d. Virtual threads are a \u201cbit heavier weight than coroutines\u201d, but might be worth it for the benefits. \u201cThreads don\u2019t scale very well in free-threading\u201d, where if virtual threads are combined with system threads, programs can get better performance. Mark encouraged others to take a look at the proposal on Discourse.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Null Coalescing Operators \u201c??\u201d</h2><p>Noah Kim proposed adding \u201cnull coalescing operators\u201d to Python. Earlier in 2025, Noah <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/revisiting-pep-505/74568\">opened a thread</a> on <a href=\"http://discuss.python.org\">discuss.python.org</a> about reviving <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0505/\">PEP 505</a>. Instead of \u201cnull\u201d, the operators would be \u201cNone\u2019-aware. The three operators being proposed are:</p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>None-aware access \u201c?.\u201d</li><li>None-aware comparison \u201c??\u201d</li><li>None-aware assignment \u201c??=\u201d</li></ul><p></p><p>Noah shared an example of using each operator. None-aware access is useful for regular expressions to \u201cconcisely emulate \u2018if is None\u2019 behavior into a single line\u201d:</p><blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">re.fullmatch(\u201cpat\u201d)?.span() == (0, 6)</span></p></blockquote><p>Defaults using None can be improved using None-aware comparison and assignment:</p><blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;\"><p><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">headers = headers ?? {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">headers ??= {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}</span></p></blockquote><p>Compared to:</p><blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;\"><p><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">if headers is None:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; headers = {\u201cContent-Type\u201d: \u201capplication/json\u201d}</span></p></blockquote><p>Noah shared a potential future for a Python that \u201cbuilds on none-ness as a core feature\u201d, such as adding <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">.first()</span> and <span style=\"font-family: courier;\">.last()</span> methods to lists when combined with none-aware operators for simpler and more correct code.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Generative AI tooling vibe check</h2><p>Gregory Smith wanted to get a general vibe-check on AI auto-completion use within an integrated development environment to work on open source software. A rough count of hands in the room showed around half of the folks had used AI autocompletion, and between a third and a quarter of people had used \u201cagentic\u201d AI for open source work.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cCPython is a very old codebase,\u201d and some modules are \u201cridiculous for humans to understand,\u201d like the Unicode module. Greg recommended core developers to try out some of the new tools and said, \u201cThe upcoming year will be intense in terms of what can be done with the tools\u201d.</p><p>Carol Willing shared that she had used and paid for a tool called \u201cCodeVis\u201d. Despite being \u201cearly days\u201d, the tool lets you ask questions about a codebase. \u201cGood for exploring codebases you don\u2019t know\u201d. Greg agreed, saying that the tools \u201ccan tell you where to go to make changes\u201d. \u201cNone of us understand the entire [CPython] codebase. These tools are helpful when plugging into another place you\u2019re not used to\u201d.</p><p>Greg is \u201ccoordinating with the Python Software Foundation\u201d on making these AI tools available for interested core developers.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Is \u201cworse is better\u201d still better?</h2><p>The creator of the Python programming language, Guido van Rossum, was next up and asked, \u201cIs \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better\">worse is better</a>\u2019 still better\u201d? Guido conceded that this was \u201cmore a rant than a proposal\u201d to \u201cget core developers thinking\u201d. Guido started by recounting earlier periods of Python development from 35 years ago, where he used UNIX \u201calmost exclusively\u201d and thus \u201cPython was greatly influenced by UNIX\u2019s \u2018worse is better\u2019 philosophy\u201d.</p><p>\u201cFor Python, \u2018worse is better\u2019 has served me really well for a long time\u201d, especially when Guido was writing most of the code. Guido shared many of the ways that early Python versions were \u201cworse\u201d than what we have today, such as no long integers, being built on top of C stdio, not having classes, etc.</p><p>These limitations meant that Guido could \u201cget something working in 3 months\u201d. \u201cEven in the language definition, I didn\u2019t think hard about many design issues, I copied what I found in C and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)\">ABC</a>, Python\u2019s predecessor\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOver the years, every single thing where I took a shortcut was eventually fixed\u201d. Dictionary hashing had been \u201crewritten twice\u201d, \u201cwe have garbage collectors up the wazoo\u201d, and \u201cnow we have a lot of tests. At the time we had no tests\u201d shared Guido with chuckles from core developers.</p><p>\u201cIn those times, \u2018worse is better\u2019 was key to getting the language accepted. I couldn\u2019t afford to work 3 years on language design without user feedback or endorphins from people giving me kudos\u201d. The initial release of Python happened less than a year after its development began, and \u201cnone of the issues were fixed, except classes,\u201d which \u201cwere added by an intern\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that [Python] wasn\u2019t perfect encouraged many people to start contributing. All of the code was straightforward, there were no thoughts of optimization\u201d. \u201cThese early contributors also now had a stake in the language; [Python] was also their baby\u201d. Guido shared that many of these contributors began advocating for Python within their individual places of work.</p><p>\u201cDoes \u2018worse is better\u2019 still have a role today?\u201d Guido contrasted early development to how Python is developed now: \u201cfeatures that take years to produce from teams of software developers paid by big tech companies. The static type system requires an academic-level understanding of esoteric type system features.\u201d And this isn\u2019t just Python the language, \u201cthird-party projects like numpy are maintained by folks who are paid full-time to do so\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNow we have a huge community, but very few people, relatively speaking, are contributing meaningfully.\u201d Guido asked whether the expectation for Python contributors going forward would be that \u201cyou had to write a perfect PEP or create a perfect prototype that can be turned into production-ready code?\u201d Guido opined for the \u201cold days\u201d where feature development could skip performance or feature-completion to get something into the hands of the community to \u201cstart kicking the tires\u201d.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to abandon \u2018worse is better\u2019 as a philosophy and try to make everything as perfect as possible?\u201d Guido thought doing so \u201cwould be a shame\u201d, but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure how to change it\u201d, acknowledging that core developers wouldn\u2019t want to create features and then break users with future releases.</p><p>Guido referenced David Hewitt\u2019s PyO3 talk about Rust and Python, and that development \u201cwas using worse is better,\u201d where there is a core feature set that works, and plenty of work to be done and open questions. \u201cThat sounds a lot more fun than working on core CPython\u201d, Guido paused, \u201c...not that I\u2019d ever personally learn Rust.

      "summary_original": "The final talk presented at the Language Summit was given by Hood Chatham, who maintains the Pyodide project and is trying to make fetch() happen for Python (among many other JavaScript APIs).Pyodide is an Emscripten Python for JavaScript runtimes like browsers, Node, and Deno. Emscripten is a \u201cweird platform, but can run an amazing amount of software without modification,\u201d explained Hood when describing the Pyodide project. Pyodide is a Tier 3 supported target for Python with PEP 776 (Emscripten Support) and PEP 783 (Emscripten Packaging).\u201cSo why would someone ever use [Pyodide]?\u201d asked Hood rhetorically, \u201c[Pyodide] performance is not great compared to native Python,\u201d although \u201csome games using Pyodide can get respectable performance in a browser\u201d. The answer is \u201cevery device has a browser\u201d and \u201czero-installation sandboxed Python\u201d. Hood shared that many Large Language Model (LLM) projects are using Pyodide and its sandbox in order to \u201crun the nonsense that AI spits out, safely\u201d. Pyodide also sees usage in other projects like Jupyter-Lite, projects providing interactive web documentation to users, and among \u201ceducators and students\u201d.Hood added, \u201cJavaScript is the operating system of the Web, and the os module only exposes a small subset of the fundamental capabilities of the Web. Python needs to be able to access all JavaScript functionality\u201d.Hood asked core developers whether the changes that Pyodide had made could be upstreamed to CPython. \u201c[The changes] are needed to implement an event loop and to make requests with fetch()\u201d. Hood explained that the Pyodide team had a prototype that allows calling \u201cawait fetch() that just works.\u201dThe prototype directly converts common types like strings, integers, floats, booleans, and None to and from JavaScript and proxies other objects. \u201cPython and JavaScript have quite similar object models with a few differences,\u201d and are capable of being mapped onto one another. Calling a JavaScript function proxies the arguments with borrowing, and the return value passes control back to the caller.Hood \u201cwasn\u2019t sure how others would feel about this,\u201d noting that \u201cnone of the changes would affect any other platforms besides Emscripten\u201d but acknowledged the patches being \u201ca weird set of code\u201d.Discussion\u0141ukasz Langa was in favor of the proposal, for two reasons: Firstly, because \u201casync cannot work without [upstream support] \u2026 the asyncio support in Pyodide goes around the event loop\u201d. \u0141ukasz continued, \u201csecondly, Micropython recently got browser support\u201d and \u201cthey have a JavaScript FFI that frustratingly is almost the same but different than Pyodide\u2019s JavaScript FFI meaning it's impossible to write code that calls the same JavaScript APIs [without] a god-awful translation layer\u201d. If Python were to have \u201can official JavaScript API, this would make [Damien George] tweak the Micropython JavaScript FFI to be the same\u201d and that having matching JavaScript FFIs \u201cwould be a big win for JavaScript support for Python\u201d.Michael Droettboom had concerns about maintenance if the code were to be upstreamed to CPython. \u201cAnytime the code breaks, it\u2019ll be on you and a small number of Pyodide maintainers to fix\u201d. Hood shared that most of the breakages experienced by the Pyodide project today are from changes to the C API, as \u201cthere are bindings that still require some private APIs\u201d. Michael closed with \u201cwe\u2019ll have to see the code\u201d.Carol Willing was concerned about the Pyodide project itself, given its success and whether \u201cbringing Pyodide into CPython\u201d would \u201ccause confusion\u201d. Hood agreed that there would be downsides to existing users, including documentation and cross-referencing to JavaScript APIs, acknowledging that there are different expectations compared to CPython.",

      "summary_original": "Kubernetes Events provide crucial insights into cluster operations, but as clusters grow, managing and analyzing these events becomes increasingly challenging. This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. The challenge with Kubernetes events In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: Volume: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute Retention: Default event retention is limited to one hour Correlation: Related events from different components are not automatically linked Classification: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications Aggregation: Similar events are not automatically grouped To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Real-World value Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The bene\ufb01t of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. Building an Event aggregation system This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example. Architecture overview This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Event Watcher: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events Event Processor: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events Storage Backend: Stores processed events for longer retention Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: package main import ( \"context\" metav1 \"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1\" \"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes\" \"k8s.io/client-go/rest\" eventsv1 \"k8s.io/api/events/v1\" ) type EventWatcher struct { clientset *kubernetes.Clientset } func NewEventWatcher(config *rest.Config) (*EventWatcher, error) { clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config) if err != nil { return nil, err } return &EventWatcher{clientset: clientset}, nil } func (w *EventWatcher) Watch(ctx context.Context) (<-chan *eventsv1.Event, error) { events := make(chan *eventsv1.Event) watcher, err := w.clientset.EventsV1().Events(\"\").Watch(ctx, metav1.ListOptions{}) if err != nil { return nil, err } go func() { defer close(events) for { select { case event := <-watcher.ResultChan(): if e, ok := event.Object.(*eventsv1.Event); ok { events <- e } case <-ctx.Done(): watcher.Stop() return } } }() return events, nil } Event processing and classification The event processor enriches events with additional context and classification: type EventProcessor struct { categoryRules []CategoryRule correlationRules []CorrelationRule } type ProcessedEvent struct { Event *eventsv1.Event Category string Severity string CorrelationID string Metadata map[string]string } func (p *EventProcessor) Process(event *eventsv1.Event) *ProcessedEvent { processed := &ProcessedEvent{ Event: event, Metadata: make(map[string]string), } // Apply classification rules processed.Category = p.classifyEvent(event) processed.Severity = p.determineSeverity(event) // Generate correlation ID for related events processed.CorrelationID = p.correlateEvent(event) // Add useful metadata processed.Metadata = p.extractMetadata(event) return processed } Implementing Event correlation One of the key features you could implement is a way of correlating related Events. Here's an example correlation strategy: func (p *EventProcessor) correlateEvent(event *eventsv1.Event) string { // Correlation strategies: // 1. Time-based: Events within a time window // 2. Resource-based: Events affecting the same resource // 3. Causation-based: Events with cause-effect relationships correlationKey := generateCorrelationKey(event) return correlationKey } func generateCorrelationKey(event *eventsv1.Event) string { // Example: Combine namespace, resource type, and name return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s/%s\", event.InvolvedObject.Namespace, event.InvolvedObject.Kind, event.InvolvedObject.Name, ) } Event storage and retention For long-term storage and analysis, you'll probably want a backend that supports: Efficient querying of large event volumes Flexible retention policies Support for aggregation queries Here's a sample storage interface: type EventStorage interface { Store(context.Context, *ProcessedEvent) error Query(context.Context, EventQuery) ([]ProcessedEvent, error) Aggregate(context.Context, AggregationParams) ([]EventAggregate, error) } type EventQuery struct { TimeRange TimeRange Categories []string Severity []string CorrelationID string Limit int } type AggregationParams struct { GroupBy []string TimeWindow string Metrics []string } Good practices for Event management Resource Efficiency Implement rate limiting for event processing Use efficient filtering at the API server level Batch events for storage operations Scalability Distribute event processing across multiple workers Use leader election for coordination Implement backoff strategies for API rate limits Reliability Handle API server disconnections gracefully Buffer events during storage backend unavailability Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff Advanced features Pattern detection Implement pattern detection to identify recurring issues: type PatternDetector struct { patterns map[string]*Pattern threshold int } func (d *PatternDetector) Detect(events []ProcessedEvent) []Pattern { // Group similar events groups := groupSimilarEvents(events) // Analyze frequency and timing patterns := identifyPatterns(groups) return patterns } func groupSimilarEvents(events []ProcessedEvent) map[string][]ProcessedEvent { groups := make(map[string][]ProcessedEvent) for _, event := range events { // Create similarity key based on event characteristics similarityKey := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%s:%s\", event.Event.Reason, event.Event.InvolvedObject.Kind, event.Event.InvolvedObject.Namespace, ) // Group events with the same key groups[similarityKey] = append(groups[similarityKey], event) } return groups } func identifyPatterns(groups map[string][]ProcessedEvent) []Pattern { var patterns []Pattern for key, events := range groups { // Only consider groups with enough events to form a pattern if len(events) < 3 { continue } // Sort events by time sort.Slice(events, func(i, j int) bool { return events[i].Event.LastTimestamp.Time.Before(events[j].Event.LastTimestamp.Time) }) // Calculate time range and frequency firstSeen := events[0].Event.FirstTimestamp.Time lastSeen := events[len(events)-1].Event.LastTimestamp.Time duration := lastSeen.Sub(firstSeen).Minutes() var frequency float64 if duration > 0 { frequency = float64(len(events)) / duration } // Create a pattern if it meets threshold criteria if frequency > 0.5 { // More than 1 event per 2 minutes pattern := Pattern{ Type: key, Count: len(events), FirstSeen: firstSeen, LastSeen: lastSeen, Frequency: frequency, EventSamples: events[:min(3, len(events))], // Keep up to 3 samples } patterns = append(patterns, pattern) } } return patterns } With this implementation, the system can identify recurring patterns such as node pressure events, pod scheduling failures, or networking issues that occur with a specific frequency. Real-time alerts The following example provides a starting point for building an alerting system based on event patterns. It is not a complete solution but a conceptual sketch to illustrate the approach. type AlertManager struct { rules []AlertRule notifiers []Notifier } func (a *AlertManager) EvaluateEvents(events []ProcessedEvent) { for _, rule := range a.rules { if rule.Matches(events) { alert := rule.GenerateAlert(events) a.notify(alert) } } } Conclusion A well-designed event aggregation system can significantly improve cluster observability and troubleshooting capabilities. By implementing custom event processing, correlation, and storage, operators can better understand cluster behavior and respond to issues more effectively. The solutions presented here can be extended and customized based on specific requirements while maintaining compatibility with the Kubernetes API and following best practices for scalability and reliability. Next steps Future enhancements could include: Machine learning for anomaly detection Integration with popular observability platforms Custom event APIs for application-specific events Enhanced visualization and reporting capabilities For more information on Kubernetes events and custom controllers, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation.",

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-with-kubernetes-events\">The challenge with Kubernetes events</h2>\n<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute</li>\n<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default event retention is limited to one hour</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Related events from different components are not automatically linked</li>\n<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: Similar events are not automatically grouped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/\">Event</a> API reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-value\">Real-World value</h2>\n<p>Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional event aggregation process:</strong> Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>With its event aggregation in its custom events:</strong> The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.</p>\n<p>The bene\ufb01t of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-an-event-aggregation-system\">Building an Event aggregation system</h2>\n<p>This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-overview\">Architecture overview</h3>\n<p>This event aggregation system consists of three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Event Watcher</strong>: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events</li>\n<li><strong>Event Processor</strong>: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Backend</strong>: Stores processed events for longer retention</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #a2f;

      "summary": "The Gateway API Inference Extension addresses challenges in routing long-running and resource-intensive AI inference sessions on Kubernetes by providing capabilities beyond traditional load balancers.",
      "summary_original": "Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges on Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don\u2019t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach is missing. Gateway API Inference Extension Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API, adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway, enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a \u201cmodel-as-a-service\u201d mindset. The project\u2019s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key objectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model roll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims to reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads. How it works The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a specific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow\u200b: InferencePool Defines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can configure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource usage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML serving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol. InferenceModel A user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., \"gpt-4-chat\") to the actual model within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they want served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy. In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform operators manage where and how it\u2019s served. Request flow The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware steps (extensions) in the middle. Here\u2019s a high-level example of the request flow with the Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE): Gateway Routing A client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions). The Gateway (like Envoy) examines the HTTPRoute and identifies the matching InferencePool backend. Endpoint Selection Instead of simply forwarding to any available pod, the Gateway consults an inference-specific routing extension\u2014 the Endpoint Selection Extension\u2014to pick the best of the available pods. This extension examines live pod metrics (queue lengths, memory usage, loaded adapters) to choose the ideal pod for the request. Inference-Aware Scheduling The chosen pod is the one that can handle the request with the lowest latency or highest efficiency, given the user\u2019s criticality or resource needs. The Gateway then forwards traffic to that specific pod. This extra step provides a smarter, model-aware routing mechanism that still feels like a normal single request to the client. Additionally, the design is extensible\u2014any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific extensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project continues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying Gateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing. Benchmarks We evaluated \u200bthis extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a vLLM\u2010based model serving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (version 1) on a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The Latency Profile Generator (LPG) tool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The ShareGPT dataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS. Key results Comparable Throughput: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard Kubernetes Service. Lower Latency: Per\u2010Output\u2010Token Latency: The \u200bESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that its model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation. Overall p90 Latency: Similar trends emerged, with the \u200bESE reducing end\u2010to\u2010end tail latencies compared to the baseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400\u2013500 QPS. These results suggest that this extension's model\u2010aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU\u2010backed LLM workloads. By dynamically selecting the least\u2010loaded or best\u2010performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can appear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long\u2010running inference requests. Roadmap As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include: Prefix-cache aware load balancing for remote caches LoRA adapter pipelines for automated rollout Fairness and priority between workloads in the same criticality band HPA support for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metrics Support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs Additional model types (e.g., diffusion models) Heterogeneous accelerators (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing) Disaggregated serving for independently scaling pools Summary By aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify and standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed. With model-aware routing, criticality-based prioritization, and more, it helps ops teams deliver the right LLM services to the right users\u2014smoothly and efficiently. Ready to learn more?

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/18/kubernetes-1-32-volume-group-snapshot-beta/",
      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. An overview of volume group snapshots Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents copies made from multiple volumes, that are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to a previous state (represented by the snapshots). Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes? The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that automates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block and file storage. Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability: Kubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and underlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the cluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge. There was already a VolumeSnapshot API that provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against data loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities not covered by the VolumeSnapshot API. Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be taken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency. This can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example, an application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume. If snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times, the application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored from those snapshots when a disaster strikes. It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from each volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the application after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get application consistent snapshots. However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently, or it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all. For example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce and nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which provides crash consistency across all volumes in the group. Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots Kubernetes' support for volume group snapshots relies on three API kinds that are used for managing snapshots: VolumeGroupSnapshot Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request creation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims. It contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the timestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use. The creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a cluster resource (a group snapshot). VolumeGroupSnapshotContent Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot. It contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group snapshot ID. This object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot). The VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it was created with a one-to-one mapping. VolumeGroupSnapshotClass Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be created, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc. These three API kinds are defined as CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs). These CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support volume group snapshots. What components are needed to support volume group snapshots Volume group snapshots are implemented in the external-snapshotter repository. Implementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components: Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs. Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller. Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller. The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per cluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver. Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon. The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver). What's new in Beta? The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the v1.11.0 release. The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed. Most of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs. Minimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules. One thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating multiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver. With the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically provisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot classes or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist. The enable-volumegroup-snapshot flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar has been replaced by a feature gate. Since VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is disabled by default. To use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag --feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true when starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar. The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common snapshot-controller. New RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from the CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly. How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to snapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot object. The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot should be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent should be used. A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator. It contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which is available for use by cluster users. One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set. selector - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped together for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label added to a PVC. volumeGroupSnapshotContentName - specifies the name of a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot. Dynamically provision a group snapshot In the following example, there are two PVCs. NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS AGE pvc-0 Bound pvc-6e1f7d34-a5c5-4548-b104-01e72c72b9f2 100Mi RWO csi-hostpath-sc <unset> 2m15s pvc-1 Bound pvc-abc640b3-2cc1-4c56-ad0c-4f0f0e636efa 100Mi RWO csi-hostpath-sc <unset> 2m7s Label the PVCs. % kubectl label pvc pvc-0 group=myGroup persistentvolumeclaim/pvc-0 labeled % kubectl label pvc pvc-1 group=myGroup persistentvolumeclaim/pvc-1 labeled For dynamic provisioning, a selector must be set so that the snapshot controller can find PVCs with the matching labels to be snapshotted together. apiVersion: groupsnapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: VolumeGroupSnapshot metadata: name: snapshot-daily-20241217 namespace: demo-namespace spec: volumeGroupSnapshotClassName: csi-groupSnapclass source: selector: matchLabels: group: myGroup In the VolumeGroupSnapshot spec, a user can specify the VolumeGroupSnapshotClass which has the information about which CSI driver should be used for creating the group snapshot.

Identify the individual volume snapshot handles, manually construct a VolumeSnapshotContent object first, then create a VolumeSnapshot object pointing to the VolumeSnapshotContent object. Repeat this for every individual volume snapshot. Then manually create a VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object, specifying the volumeGroupSnapshotHandle and individual volumeSnapshotHandles already existing on the storage system. apiVersion: groupsnapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: VolumeGroupSnapshotContent metadata: name: static-group-content spec: deletionPolicy: Delete driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io source: groupSnapshotHandles: volumeGroupSnapshotHandle: e8779136-a93e-11ef-9549-66940726f2fd volumeSnapshotHandles: - e8779147-a93e-11ef-9549-66940726f2fd - e8783cd0-a93e-11ef-9549-66940726f2fd volumeGroupSnapshotRef: name: static-group-snapshot namespace: demo-namespace After that create a VolumeGroupSnapshot object pointing to the VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object. apiVersion: groupsnapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: VolumeGroupSnapshot metadata: name: static-group-snapshot namespace: demo-namespace spec: source: volumeGroupSnapshotContentName: static-group-content How to use group snapshot for restore in Kubernetes At restore time, the user can request a new PersistentVolumeClaim to be created from a VolumeSnapshot object that is part of a VolumeGroupSnapshot. This will trigger provisioning of a new volume that is pre-populated with data from the specified snapshot. The user should repeat this until all volumes are created from all the snapshots that are part of a group snapshot. apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: examplepvc-restored-2024-12-17 namespace: demo-namespace spec: storageClassName: example-foo-nearline dataSource: name: snapshot-0962a745b2bf930bb385b7b50c9b08af471f1a16780726de19429dd9c94eaca0 kind: VolumeSnapshot apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io accessModes: - ReadWriteOncePod resources: requests: storage: 100Mi # must be enough storage to fit the existing snapshot As a storage vendor, how do I add support for group snapshots to my CSI driver? To implement the volume group snapshot feature, a CSI driver must: Implement a new group controller service. Implement group controller RPCs: CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot, DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot, and GetVolumeGroupSnapshot. Add group controller capability CREATE_DELETE_GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT. See the CSI spec and the Kubernetes-CSI Driver Developer Guide for more details. As mentioned earlier, it is strongly recommended that Kubernetes distributors bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver). As part of this recommended deployment process, the Kubernetes team provides a number of sidecar (helper) containers, including the external-snapshotter sidecar container which has been updated to support volume group snapshot. The external-snapshotter watches the Kubernetes API server for VolumeGroupSnapshotContent objects, and triggers CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot and DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot operations against a CSI endpoint. What are the limitations? The beta implementation of volume group snapshots for Kubernetes has the following limitations: Does not support reverting an existing PVC to an earlier state represented by a snapshot (only supports provisioning a new volume from a snapshot). No application consistency guarantees beyond any guarantees provided by the storage system (e.g. crash consistency). See this doc for more discussions on application consistency. What\u2019s next? Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release. How can I learn more? The design spec for the volume group snapshot feature. The code repository for volume group snapshot APIs and controller. CSI documentation on the group snapshot feature. How do I get involved? This project, like all of Kubernetes, is the result of hard work by many contributors from diverse backgrounds working together. On behalf of SIG Storage, I would like to offer a huge thank you to the contributors who stepped up these last few quarters to help the project reach beta: Ben Swartzlander (bswartz) Cici Huang (cici37) Hemant Kumar (gnufied) James Defelice (jdef) Jan \u0160afr\u00e1nek (jsafrane) Madhu Rajanna (Madhu-1) Manish M Yathnalli (manishym) Michelle Au (msau42) Niels de Vos (nixpanic) Leonardo Cecchi (leonardoce) Rakshith R (Rakshith-R) Raunak Shah (RaunakShah) Saad Ali (saad-ali) Xing Yang (xing-yang) Yati Padia (yati1998) For those interested in getting involved with the design and development of CSI or any part of the Kubernetes Storage system, join the Kubernetes Storage Special Interest Group (SIG).

          "summary_text": "<p>Volume group snapshots were <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/08/kubernetes-1-27-volume-group-snapshot-alpha/\">introduced</a>\nas an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release.\nThe recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>.\nThe support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/group-snapshot-restore-feature.html#volume-group-snapshot-apis\">extension APIs for group snapshots</a>.\nThese APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.\nBehind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims\nfor snapshotting.\nA key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and\nrecover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>\n<p>This new feature is only supported for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots\">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of\nmultiple volumes. A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that\nare taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate\nnew volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to\na previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes\">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that\nautomates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block\nand file storage.</p>\n<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:\nKubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and\nunderlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the\ncluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>There was already a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/\">VolumeSnapshot</a> API\nthat provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against\ndata loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities\nnot covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>\n<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be\ntaken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.\nThis can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,\nan application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.\nIf snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,\nthe application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored\nfrom those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from\neach volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the\napplication after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get\napplication consistent snapshots.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,\nor it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.\nFor example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce\nand nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which\nprovides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots\">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that\nare used\nfor managing snapshots:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>\n<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request\ncreation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the\ntimestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.\nThe creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a\ncluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>\n<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group\nsnapshot ID.\nThis object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).\nThe VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it\nwas created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>\n<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be\ncreated, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These three API kinds are defined as\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>\n(CRDs).\nThese CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support\nvolume group snapshots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots\">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">external-snapshotter</a> repository.\nImplementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>\n<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per\ncluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors\nbundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part\nof their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-beta\">What's new in Beta?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0\">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.\nMost of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.\nMinimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.\nOne thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating\nmultiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes\nfor the same CSI driver.\nWith the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically\nprovisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot\nclasses or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter\nsidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.\nSince VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is\ndisabled by default.\nTo use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>\nwhen starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual\nVolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common\nsnapshot-controller.\nNew RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from\nthe CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots\">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes\">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to\nsnapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot\nobject.</p>\n<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot\nshould be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent\nshould be used.</p>\n<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.\nIt contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which\nis available for use by cluster users.</p>\n<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped\ntogether for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label\nadded to a PVC.</li>\n<li><code>volumeGroupSnapshotContentName</code> - specifies the name of a pre-existing\nVolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"dynamically-provision-a-group-snapshot\">Dynamically provision a group snapshot</h4>\n<p>In the following example, there are two PVCs.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">pvc-0 Bound pvc-6e1f7d34-a5c5-4548-b104-01e72c72b9f2 100Mi RWO csi-hostpath-sc &lt;unset&gt;

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "Editors: Matteo Bianchi, Edith Puclla, William Rizzo, Ryota Sawada, Rashan Smith Announcing the release of Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope! In line with previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. Release theme and logo The Kubernetes v1.32 Release Theme is \"Penelope\". If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for \"pilot\", in this release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in \"The Odyssey\", weaved for 10 years -- each night removing parts of what she had done during the day -- so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1.32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary, we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together. Updates to recent key features A note on DRA enhancements In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters. These features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing applications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support got promoted to beta. Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update SIG Node has the following highlights that go beyond KEPs: The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting the maximum number of restarts within a given time period. This enhances the reliability of the kubelet. For more details, see pull request #127566. In cases when an image pull back-off error is encountered, the message displayed in the Pod status has been improved to be more human-friendly and to indicate details about why the Pod is in this condition. When an image pull back-off occurs, the error is appended to the status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.message field in the Pod specification with an ImagePullBackOff value in the reason field. This change provides you with more context and helps you to identify the root cause of the issue. For more details, see pull request #127918. The sidecar containers feature is targeting graduation to Stable in v1.33. To view the remaining work items and feedback from users, see comments in the issue #753. Highlights of features graduating to Stable This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.32 release. Custom Resource field selectors Custom resource field selector allows developers to add field selectors to custom resources, mirroring the functionality available for built-in Kubernetes objects. This allows for more efficient and precise filtering of custom resources, promoting better API design practices. This work was done as a part of KEP #4358, by SIG API Machinery. Support to size memory backed volumes This feature makes it possible to dynamically size memory-backed volumes based on Pod resource limits, improving the workload's portability and overall node resource utilization. This work was done as a part of KEP #1967, by SIG Node. Bound service account token improvement The inclusion of the node name in the service account token claims allows users to use such information during authorization and admission (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy). Furthermore this improvement keeps service account credentials from being a privilege escalation path for nodes. This work was done as part of KEP #4193 by SIG Auth. Structured authorization configuration Multiple authorizers can be configured in the API server to allow for structured authorization decisions, with support for CEL match conditions in webhooks. This work was done as part of KEP #3221 by SIG Auth. Auto remove PVCs created by StatefulSet PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) created by StatefulSets get automatically deleted when no longer needed, while ensuring data persistence during StatefulSet updates and node maintenance. This feature simplifies storage management for StatefulSets and reduces the risk of orphaned PVCs. This work was done as part of KEP #1847 by SIG Apps. Highlights of features graduating to Beta This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.32 release. Job API managed-by mechanism The managedBy field for Jobs was promoted to beta in the v1.32 release. This feature enables external controllers (like Kueue) to manage Job synchronization, offering greater flexibility and integration with advanced workload management systems. This work was done as a part of KEP #4368, by SIG Apps. Only allow anonymous auth for configured endpoints This feature lets admins specify which endpoints are allowed for anonymous requests. For example, the admin can choose to only allow anonymous access to health endpoints like /healthz, /livez, and /readyz while making sure preventing anonymous access to other cluster endpoints or resources even if a user misconfigures RBAC. This work was done as a part of KEP #4633, by SIG Auth. Per-plugin callback functions for accurate requeueing in kube-scheduler enhancements This feature enhances scheduling throughput with more efficient scheduling retry decisions by per-plugin callback functions (QueueingHint). All plugins now have QueueingHints. This work was done as a part of KEP #4247, by SIG Scheduling. Recover from volume expansion failure This feature lets users recover from volume expansion failure by retrying with a smaller size. This enhancement ensures that volume expansion is more resilient and reliable, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption during the process. This work was done as a part of KEP #1790, by SIG Storage. Volume group snapshot This feature introduces a VolumeGroupSnapshot API, which lets users take a snapshot of multiple volumes together, ensuring data consistency across the volumes. This work was done as a part of KEP #3476, by SIG Storage. Structured parameter support The core part of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), the structured parameter support, got promoted to beta. This allows the kube-scheduler and Cluster Autoscaler to simulate claim allocation directly, without needing a third-party driver. These components can now predict whether resource requests can be fulfilled based on the cluster's current state without actually committing to the allocation. By eliminating the need for a third-party driver to validate or test allocations, this feature improves planning and decision-making for resource distribution, making the scheduling and scaling processes more efficient. This work was done as a part of KEP #4381, by WG Device Management (a cross functional team containing SIG Node, SIG Scheduling and SIG Autoscaling). Label and field selector authorization Label and field selectors can be used in authorization decisions. The node authorizer automatically takes advantage of this to limit nodes to list or watch their pods only. Webhook authorizers can be updated to limit requests based on the label or field selector used. This work was done as part of KEP #4601 by SIG Auth. Highlights of new features in Alpha This is a selection of key improvements introduced as alpha features in the v1.32 release. Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler The Kubernetes scheduler has been enhanced with Asynchronous Preemption, a feature that improves scheduling throughput by handling preemption operations asynchronously. Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods, slowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays. This improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a more efficient and resilient scheduling process. This work was done as a part of KEP #4832 by SIG Scheduling. Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply\u2019s merge algorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance while laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes. The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a lightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to declare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions. This approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the kube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling. This work was done as a part of KEP #3962 by SIG API Machinery. Pod-level resource specifications This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and limits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly valuable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning and improves overall resource efficiency. By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while enabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly, this feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt it incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations. This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing resource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such as sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other\u2019s availability to perform optimally. This work was done as part of KEP #2837 by SIG Node. Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in Kubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting to define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users can configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors where needed. The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop hooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the capabilities of the time.After Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes workloads. This work was done as part of KEP #4818 by SIG Node. DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object in a ResourceClaim. It also establishes a standardized way to represent networking devices information. This work was done as a part of KEP #4817, by SIG Network. New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components You can enable two new HTTP endpoints, /statusz and /flagz, for core components. These enhance cluster debuggability by gaining insight into what versions (e.g. Golang version) that component is running as, along with details about its uptime, and which command line flags that component was executed with; making it easier to diagnose both runtime and configuration issues. This work was done as part of KEP #4827 and KEP #4828 by SIG Instrumentation. Windows strikes back! Support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters has been added. Before this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes but lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system shutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated, allowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability of clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates. Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements to the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager. This work was done respectively as part of KEP #4802 and KEP #4885 by SIG Windows. Graduations, deprecations, and removals in 1.32 Graduations to Stable This lists all the features that graduated to stable (also known as general availability). For a full list of updates including new features and graduations from alpha to beta, see the release notes. This release includes a total of 13 enhancements promoted to Stable: Structured Authorization Configuration Bound service account token improvements Custom Resource Field Selectors Retry Generate Name Make Kubernetes aware of the LoadBalancer behaviour Field status.hostIPs added for Pod Custom profile in kubectl debug Memory Manager Support to size memory backed volumes Improved multi-numa alignment in Topology Manager Add job creation timestamp to job annotations Add Pod Index Label for StatefulSets and Indexed Jobs Auto remove PVCs created by StatefulSet Deprecations and removals As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project's overall health. See the Kubernetes deprecation and removal policy for more details on this process. Withdrawal of the old DRA implementation The enhancement #3063 introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in Kubernetes 1.26. However, in Kubernetes v1.32, this approach to DRA will be significantly changed. Code related to the original implementation will be removed, leaving KEP #4381 as the \"new\" base functionality. The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource availability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers. The newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality. This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing the complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver. See the enhancement issue #3063 to find out more. API removals There is one API removal in Kubernetes v1.32: The flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed. To prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since v1.29. All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares field only defaults to 30 when unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30. For more information, refer to the API deprecation guide. Release notes and upgrade actions required Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.32 release in our release notes.

These enhancements aim\nto improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such\nas GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters.\nThese features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing\napplications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#structured-parameter-support\">got promoted to beta</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quality-of-life-improvements-on-nodes-and-sidecar-containers-update\">Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG Node</a> has the following highlights that go beyond\nKEPs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting\nthe maximum number of restarts within a given time period. This enhances the reliability of the kubelet. For more\ndetails, see pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566\">#127566</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In cases when an image pull back-off error is encountered, the message displayed in the Pod status has been improved\nto be more human-friendly and to indicate details about why the Pod is in this condition.\nWhen an image pull back-off occurs, the error is appended to the <code>status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.message</code>\nfield in the Pod specification with an <code>ImagePullBackOff</code> value in the <code>reason</code> field. This change provides you with\nmore context and helps you to identify the root cause of the issue. For more details, see pull request\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127918\">#127918</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sidecar containers feature is targeting graduation to Stable in v1.33.

This feature enables external controllers\n(like <a href=\"https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kueue</a>) to manage Job synchronization, offering greater flexibility and integration\nwith advanced workload management systems.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4368\">KEP #4368</a>, by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps\">SIG\nApps</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"only-allow-anonymous-auth-for-configured-endpoints\">Only allow anonymous auth for configured endpoints</h3>\n<p>This feature lets admins specify which endpoints are allowed for anonymous requests. For example, the admin\ncan choose to only allow anonymous access to health endpoints like <code>/healthz</code>, <code>/livez</code>, and <code>/readyz</code> while\nmaking sure preventing anonymous access to other cluster endpoints or resources even if a user\nmisconfigures RBAC.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4633\">KEP #4633</a>, by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-auth\">SIG\nAuth</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"per-plugin-callback-functions-for-accurate-requeueing-in-kube-scheduler-enhancements\">Per-plugin callback functions for accurate requeueing in kube-scheduler\u00a0enhancements</h3>\n<p>This feature enhances scheduling throughput with more efficient scheduling retry decisions by\nper-plugin callback functions (QueueingHint). All plugins now have QueueingHints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4247\">KEP #4247</a>, by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG\nScheduling</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recover-from-volume-expansion-failure\">Recover from volume expansion failure</h3>\n<p>This feature lets users recover from volume expansion failure by retrying with a smaller size. This enhancement ensures\nthat volume expansion is more resilient and reliable, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption during the process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1790\">KEP #1790</a>, by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage\">SIG\nStorage</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-group-snapshot\">Volume group snapshot</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces a VolumeGroupSnapshot API, which lets users take a snapshot of multiple volumes together, ensuring data consistency across the volumes.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3476\">KEP #3476</a>, by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage\">SIG\nStorage</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>The core part of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), the structured parameter support, got promoted to beta.\nThis allows the kube-scheduler and Cluster Autoscaler to simulate claim allocation directly, without needing a\nthird-party driver.\nThese components can now predict whether resource requests can be fulfilled based on the cluster's current state without actually\ncommitting to the allocation. By eliminating the need for a third-party driver to validate or test allocations, this\nfeature improves planning and decision-making for resource distribution, making the scheduling and scaling processes\nmore efficient.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381\">KEP #4381</a>, by WG Device\nManagement (a cross functional team containing <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG Node</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling\">SIG\nAutoscaling</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"label-and-field-selector-authorization\">Label and field selector authorization</h3>\n<p>Label and field selectors can be used in authorization decisions. The node authorizer\nautomatically takes advantage of this to limit nodes to list or watch their pods only.\nWebhook authorizers can be updated to limit requests based on the label or field selector used.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4601\">KEP #4601</a>\nby <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-auth\">SIG Auth</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highlights-of-new-features-in-alpha\">Highlights of new features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of key improvements introduced as alpha features in the v1.32 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the\u00a0Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes scheduler has been enhanced with Asynchronous Preemption, a feature that improves scheduling throughput\nby handling preemption operations asynchronously. Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by\nevicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods,\nslowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to\ncontinue scheduling other pods without delays.\nThis improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a\nmore efficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of KEP <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4832\">#4832</a>\nby <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutating-admission-policies-using-cel-expressions\">Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions</h3>\n<p>This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply\u2019s merge\nalgorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance\nwhile laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a\nlightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to\ndeclare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions.\nThis approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the\nkube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962\">KEP #3962</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-level-resource-specifications\">Pod-level resource specifications</h3>\n<p>This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and\nlimits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly\nvaluable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning\nand improves overall resource efficiency.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while\nenabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly,\nthis feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt\nit incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations.</p>\n<p>This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing\nresource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such\nas sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other\u2019s availability to perform optimally.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837\">KEP #2837</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook\">Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in\nKubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting\nto define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users\ncan configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors\nwhere needed.</p>\n<p>The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the\n<code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop\nhooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the\ncapabilities of the <code>time.After</code> Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4818\">KEP #4818</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status\">DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status</h3>\n<p>This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object\nin a ResourceClaim. It also establishes a standardized way to represent networking devices information.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4817\">KEP #4817</a>, by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network\">SIG Network</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-statusz-and-flagz-endpoints-for-core-components\">New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components</h3>\n<p>You can enable two new HTTP endpoints, <code>/statusz</code> and <code>/flagz</code>, for core components.\nThese enhance cluster debuggability by gaining insight into what versions (e.g. Golang version) that component is\nrunning as, along with details about its uptime, and which command line flags that component was executed with;\nmaking it easier to diagnose both runtime and configuration issues.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4827\">KEP #4827</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4828\">KEP #4828</a> by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG Instrumentation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"windows-strikes-back\">Windows strikes back!</h3>\n<p>Support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters has been added.\nBefore this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes\nbut lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system\nshutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated,\nallowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability\nof clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates.</p>\n<p>Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements\nto the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager.</p>\n<p>This work was done respectively as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4802\">KEP #4802</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4885\">KEP #4885</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows\">SIG\nWindows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-deprecations-and-removals-in-1-32\">Graduations, deprecations, and removals in 1.32</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to Stable</h3>\n<p>This lists all the features that graduated to stable (also known as <em>general availability</em>).

These enhancements aim\nto improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such\nas GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters.\nThese features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing\napplications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#structured-parameter-support\">got promoted to beta</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quality-of-life-improvements-on-nodes-and-sidecar-containers-update\">Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG Node</a> has the following highlights that go beyond\nKEPs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting\nthe maximum number of restarts within a given time period. This enhances the reliability of the kubelet. For more\ndetails, see pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566\">#127566</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In cases when an image pull back-off error is encountered, the message displayed in the Pod status has been improved\nto be more human-friendly and to indicate details about why the Pod is in this condition.\nWhen an image pull back-off occurs, the error is appended to the <code>status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.message</code>\nfield in the Pod specification with an <code>ImagePullBackOff</code> value in the <code>reason</code> field. This change provides you with\nmore context and helps you to identify the root cause of the issue.

Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by\nevicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods,\nslowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to\ncontinue scheduling other pods without delays.\nThis improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a\nmore efficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of KEP <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4832\">#4832</a>\nby <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutating-admission-policies-using-cel-expressions\">Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions</h3>\n<p>This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply\u2019s merge\nalgorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance\nwhile laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a\nlightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to\ndeclare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions.\nThis approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the\nkube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962\">KEP #3962</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-level-resource-specifications\">Pod-level resource specifications</h3>\n<p>This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and\nlimits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly\nvaluable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning\nand improves overall resource efficiency.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while\nenabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly,\nthis feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt\nit incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations.</p>\n<p>This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing\nresource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such\nas sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other\u2019s availability to perform optimally.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837\">KEP #2837</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook\">Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in\nKubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting\nto define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users\ncan configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors\nwhere needed.</p>\n<p>The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the\n<code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop\nhooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the\ncapabilities of the <code>time.After</code> Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4818\">KEP #4818</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status\">DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status</h3>\n<p>This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object\nin a ResourceClaim.

This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system\nshutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated,\nallowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability\nof clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates.</p>\n<p>Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements\nto the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager.</p>\n<p>This work was done respectively as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4802\">KEP #4802</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4885\">KEP #4885</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows\">SIG\nWindows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-deprecations-and-removals-in-1-32\">Graduations, deprecations, and removals in 1.32</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to Stable</h3>\n<p>This lists all the features that graduated to stable (also known as <em>general availability</em>).

Code related to the original\nimplementation will be removed, leaving KEP <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381\">#4381</a> as the &quot;new&quot;\nbase functionality.</p>\n<p>The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource\navailability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers.\nThe newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality.</p>\n<p>This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing\nthe complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver.</p>\n<p>See the enhancement issue <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063\">#3063</a> to find out more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"api-removals\">API removals</h4>\n<p>There is one API removal in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32\">Kubernetes v1.32</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3</code> API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed.\nTo prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the\n<code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API</code> version, available since v1.29.\nAll existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3\ninclude that the PriorityLevelConfiguration <code>spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares</code> field only defaults to 30 when\nunspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32\">API deprecation guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"release-notes-and-upgrade-actions-required\">Release notes and upgrade actions required</h3>\n<p>Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.32 release in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md\">release\nnotes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.32 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.32.0\">GitHub</a> or\non the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/\">Kubernetes download page</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started with Kubernetes, check out these <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/\">interactive tutorials</a> or run local Kubernetes\nclusters using <a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/\">minikube</a>.

      "summary": "Google develops advanced weather forecasting tools to improve accuracy and reliability in predictions.",
      "summary_original": "Posted by Lizao (Larry) Li, Software Engineer, and Rob Carver, Research Scientist, Google Research Accurate weather forecasts can have a direct impact on people\u2019s lives, from helping make routine decisions, like what to pack for a day\u2019s activities, to informing urgent actions, for example, protecting people in the face of hazardous weather conditions. The importance of accurate and timely weather forecasts will only increase as the climate changes. Recognizing this, we at Google have been investing in weather and climate research to help ensure that the forecasting technology of tomorrow can meet the demand for reliable weather information. Some of our recent innovations include MetNet-3, Google's high-resolution forecasts up to 24-hours into the future, and GraphCast, a weather model that can predict weather up to 10 days ahead. Weather is inherently stochastic. To quantify the uncertainty, traditional methods rely on physics-based simulation to generate an ensemble of forecasts. However, it is computationally costly to generate a large ensemble so that rare and extreme weather events can be discerned and characterized accurately. With that in mind, we are excited to announce our latest innovation designed to accelerate progress in weather forecasting, Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS), recently published in Science Advances. SEEDS is a generative AI model that can efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts at scale at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models. This technology opens up novel opportunities for weather and climate science, and it represents one of the first applications to weather and climate forecasting of probabilistic diffusion models, a generative AI technology behind recent advances in media generation. The need for probabilistic forecasts: the butterfly effect In December 1972, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Washington, D.C., MIT meteorology professor Ed Lorenz gave a talk entitled, \u201cDoes the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?\u201d which contributed to the term \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d. He was building on his earlier, landmark 1963 paper where he examined the feasibility of \u201cvery-long-range weather prediction\u201d and described how errors in initial conditions grow exponentially when integrated in time with numerical weather prediction models. This exponential error growth, known as chaos, results in a deterministic predictability limit that restricts the use of individual forecasts in decision making, because they do not quantify the inherent uncertainty of weather conditions. This is particularly problematic when forecasting extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, or floods. Recognizing the limitations of deterministic forecasts, weather agencies around the world issue probabilistic forecasts. Such forecasts are based on ensembles of deterministic forecasts, each of which is generated by including synthetic noise in the initial conditions and stochasticity in the physical processes. Leveraging the fast error growth rate in weather models, the forecasts in an ensemble are purposefully different: the initial uncertainties are tuned to generate runs that are as different as possible and the stochastic processes in the weather model introduce additional differences during the model run. The error growth is mitigated by averaging all the forecasts in the ensemble and the variability in the ensemble of forecasts quantifies the uncertainty of the weather conditions. While effective, generating these probabilistic forecasts is computationally costly. They require running highly complex numerical weather models on massive supercomputers multiple times. Consequently, many operational weather forecasts can only afford to generate ~10\u201350 ensemble members for each forecast cycle. This is a problem for users concerned with the likelihood of rare but high-impact weather events, which typically require much larger ensembles to assess beyond a few days. For instance, one would need a 10,000-member ensemble to forecast the likelihood of events with 1% probability of occurrence with a relative error less than 10%. Quantifying the probability of such extreme events could be useful, for example, for emergency management preparation or for energy traders. SEEDS: AI-enabled advances In the aforementioned paper, we present the Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS), a generative AI technology for weather forecast ensemble generation. SEEDS is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, a state-of-the-art generative AI method pioneered in part by Google Research. SEEDS can generate a large ensemble conditioned on as few as one or two forecasts from an operational numerical weather prediction system. The generated ensembles not only yield plausible real-weather\u2013like forecasts but also match or exceed physics-based ensembles in skill metrics such as the rank histogram, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). In particular, the generated ensembles assign more accurate likelihoods to the tail of the forecast distribution, such as \u00b12\u03c3 and \u00b13\u03c3 weather events. Most importantly, the computational cost of the model is negligible when compared to the hours of computational time needed by supercomputers to make a forecast. It has a throughput of 256 ensemble members (at 2\u00b0 resolution) per 3 minutes on Google Cloud TPUv3-32 instances and can easily scale to higher throughput by deploying more accelerators. SEEDS generates an order-of-magnitude more samples to in-fill distributions of weather patterns. Generating plausible weather forecasts Generative AI is known to generate very detailed images and videos. This property is especially useful for generating ensemble forecasts that are consistent with plausible weather patterns, which ultimately result in the most added value for downstream applications. As Lorenz points out, \u201cThe [weather forecast] maps which they produce should look like real weather maps.\" The figure below contrasts the forecasts from SEEDS to those from the operational U.S. weather prediction system (Global Ensemble Forecast System, GEFS) for a particular date during the 2022 European heat waves. We also compare the results to the forecasts from a Gaussian model that predicts the univariate mean and standard deviation of each atmospheric field at each location, a common and computationally efficient but less sophisticated data-driven approach. This Gaussian model is meant to characterize the output of pointwise post-processing, which ignores correlations and treats each grid point as an independent random variable. In contrast, a real weather map would have detailed correlational structures. Because SEEDS directly models the joint distribution of the atmospheric state, it realistically captures both the spatial covariance and the correlation between mid-tropospheric geopotential and mean sea level pressure, both of which are closely related and are commonly used by weather forecasters for evaluation and verification of forecasts. Gradients in the mean sea level pressure are what drive winds at the surface, while gradients in mid-tropospheric geopotential create upper-level winds that move large-scale weather patterns. The generated samples from SEEDS shown in the figure below (frames Ca\u2013Ch) display a geopotential trough west of Portugal with spatial structure similar to that found in the operational U.S. forecasts or the reanalysis based on observations. Although the Gaussian model predicts the marginal univariate distributions adequately, it fails to capture cross-field or spatial correlations. This hinders the assessment of the effects that these anomalies may have on hot air intrusions from North Africa, which can exacerbate heat waves over Europe. Stamp maps over Europe on 2022/07/14 at 0:00 UTC. The contours are for the mean sea level pressure (dashed lines mark isobars below 1010 hPa) while the heatmap depicts the geopotential height at the 500 hPa pressure level. (A) The ERA5 reanalysis, a proxy for real observations. (Ba-Bb) 2 members from the 7-day U.S. operational forecasts used as seeds to our model. (Ca-Ch) 8 samples drawn from SEEDS. (Da-Dh) 8 non-seeding members from the 7-day U.S. operational ensemble forecast. (Ea-Ed) 4 samples from a pointwise Gaussian model parameterized by the mean and variance of the entire U.S. operational ensemble. Covering extreme events more accurately Below we show the joint distributions of temperature at 2 meters and total column water vapor near Lisbon during the extreme heat event on 2022/07/14, at 1:00 local time. We used the 7-day forecasts issued on 2022/07/07. For each plot, we generate 16,384-member ensembles with SEEDS. The observed weather event from ERA5 is denoted by the star. The operational ensemble is also shown, with squares denoting the forecasts used to seed the generated ensembles, and triangles denoting the rest of ensemble members. SEEDS provides better statistical coverage of the 2022/07/14 European extreme heat event, denoted by the brown star . Each plot shows the values of the total column-integrated water vapor (TCVW) vs. temperature over a grid point near Lisbon, Portugal from 16,384 samples generated by our models, shown as green dots, conditioned on 2 seeds (blue squares) taken from the 7-day U.S. operational ensemble forecasts (denoted by the sparser brown triangles). The valid forecast time is 1:00 local time. The solid contour levels correspond to iso-proportions of the kernel density of SEEDS, with the outermost one encircling 95% of the mass and 11.875% between each level. According to the U.S. operational ensemble, the observed event was so unlikely seven days prior that none of its 31 members predicted near-surface temperatures as warm as those observed. Indeed, the event probability computed from a Gaussian kernel density estimate is lower than 1%, which means that ensembles with less than 100 members are unlikely to contain forecasts as extreme as this event. In contrast, the SEEDS ensembles are able to extrapolate from the two seeding forecasts, providing an envelope of possible weather states with much better statistical coverage of the event. This allows both quantifying the probability of the event taking place and sampling weather regimes under which it would occur. Specifically, our highly scalable generative approach enables the creation of very large ensembles that can characterize very rare events by providing samples of weather states exceeding a given threshold for any user-defined diagnostic. Conclusion and future outlook SEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace. The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version. This leads to a hybrid forecasting system where a few weather trajectories computed with a physics-based model are used to seed a diffusion model that can generate additional forecasts much more efficiently. This methodology provides an alternative to the current operational weather forecasting paradigm, where the computational resources saved by the statistical emulator could be allocated to increasing the resolution of the physics-based model or issuing forecasts more frequently. We believe that SEEDS represents just one of the many ways that AI will accelerate progress in operational numerical weather prediction in coming years. We hope this demonstration of the utility of generative AI for weather forecast emulation and post-processing will spur its application in research areas such as climate risk assessment, where generating a large number of ensembles of climate projections is crucial to accurately quantifying the uncertainty about future climate.

Some of our recent innovations include <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html\">MetNet-3</a>, Google's high-resolution forecasts up to 24-hours into the future, and <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/\">GraphCast</a>, a weather model that can predict weather up to 10 days ahead.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a> \n\n<p>\nWeather is inherently stochastic. To quantify the uncertainty, traditional methods rely on physics-based simulation to generate an ensemble of forecasts. However, it is computationally costly to generate a large ensemble so that rare and extreme weather events can be discerned and characterized accurately.  \n</p>\n<p>\nWith that in mind, we are excited to announce our latest innovation designed to accelerate progress in weather forecasting, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489\">Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler</a> (SEEDS), recently published in <em><a href=\"https://www.science.org/journal/sciadv\">Science Advances</a></em>. SEEDS is a generative AI model that can efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts <em>at scale </em>at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models. This technology opens up novel opportunities for weather and climate science, and it represents one of the first applications to weather and climate forecasting of probabilistic diffusion models, a generative AI technology behind recent advances in media generation.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>The need for probabilistic forecasts: the butterfly effect</h2>\n\n<p>\nIn December 1972, at the <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/\">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> meeting in Washington, D.C., MIT meteorology professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz\">Ed Lorenz</a> gave a talk entitled, \u201cDoes the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?\u201d which contributed to the term \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect\">butterfly effect</a>\u201d. He was building on his earlier, landmark 1963 paper where he examined the feasibility of \u201cvery-long-range weather prediction\u201d and described how errors in initial conditions grow exponentially when integrated in time with numerical weather prediction models. This exponential error growth, known as chaos, results in a deterministic predictability limit that restricts the use of individual forecasts in decision making, because they do not quantify the inherent uncertainty of weather conditions. This is particularly problematic when forecasting extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, or floods.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecognizing the limitations of deterministic forecasts, weather agencies around the world issue <em>probabilistic forecasts</em>. Such forecasts are based on ensembles of deterministic forecasts, each of which is generated by including synthetic noise in the initial conditions and stochasticity in the physical processes. Leveraging the fast error growth rate in weather models, the forecasts in an ensemble are purposefully different: the initial uncertainties are tuned to generate runs that are as different as possible and the stochastic processes in the weather model introduce additional differences during the model run. The error growth is mitigated by averaging all the forecasts in the ensemble and the variability in the ensemble of forecasts quantifies the uncertainty of the weather conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile effective, generating these probabilistic forecasts is computationally costly. They require running highly complex numerical weather models on massive supercomputers multiple times. Consequently, many operational weather forecasts can only afford to generate ~10\u201350 ensemble members for each forecast cycle. This is a problem for users concerned with the likelihood of rare but high-impact weather events, which typically require much larger ensembles to assess beyond a few days. For instance, one would need a 10,000-member ensemble to forecast the likelihood of events with 1% probability of occurrence with a relative error less than 10%. Quantifying the probability of such extreme events could be useful, for example, for emergency management preparation or for energy traders.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>SEEDS: AI-enabled advances</h2>\n\n<p>\nIn the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489\">paper</a>, we present the Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS), a generative AI technology for weather forecast ensemble generation. SEEDS is based on <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2021/07/high-fidelity-image-generation-using.html\">denoising diffusion probabilistic</a> models, a state-of-the-art generative AI method pioneered in part by Google Research.\n</p>\n<p>\nSEEDS can generate a large ensemble conditioned on as few as one or two forecasts from an operational numerical weather prediction system. The generated ensembles not only yield plausible real-weather\u2013like forecasts but also match or exceed physics-based ensembles in skill metrics such as the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201352\">rank histogram</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation\">root-mean-squared error</a> (RMSE), and the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000001437\">continuous ranked probability score</a> (CRPS). In particular, the generated ensembles assign more accurate likelihoods to the tail of the forecast distribution, such as \u00b12\u03c3 and \u00b13\u03c3 weather events. Most importantly, the computational cost of the model is negligible when compared to the hours of computational time needed by supercomputers to make a forecast. It has a throughput of 256 ensemble members (at 2\u00b0 resolution) per 3 minutes on Google Cloud TPUv3-32 instances and can easily scale to higher throughput by deploying more accelerators. \n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglI5U51vvhkA4cAuVvMLn0TbbL5pdlFL-LO1sNnqLyUieA6A88I5HrhJlszxR1GKQqSK5wsdlATDKSy6EC1BsNF7tzS6oVlFLtau13mVFLk954nFu85HDMP3PrQboG4eXExEtUjEuDRFpcrMqE_F0ikSwXiWBECAfJiLbjr6h6523DROJkbC284xX35zC7/s1000/image3.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglI5U51vvhkA4cAuVvMLn0TbbL5pdlFL-LO1sNnqLyUieA6A88I5HrhJlszxR1GKQqSK5wsdlATDKSy6EC1BsNF7tzS6oVlFLtau13mVFLk954nFu85HDMP3PrQboG4eXExEtUjEuDRFpcrMqE_F0ikSwXiWBECAfJiLbjr6h6523DROJkbC284xX35zC7/s16000/image3.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">SEEDS generates an order-of-magnitude more samples to in-fill distributions of weather patterns.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n\n<h2>Generating plausible weather forecasts</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nGenerative AI is known to generate very detailed images and videos. This property is especially useful for generating ensemble forecasts that are consistent with plausible weather patterns, which ultimately result in the most added value for downstream applications.  As Lorenz points out, \u201cThe [weather forecast] maps which they produce should look like real weather maps.\" The figure below contrasts the forecasts from SEEDS to those from the operational U.S. weather prediction system (<a href=\"https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gefs.php\">Global Ensemble Forecast System</a>, GEFS) for a particular date during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_heatwaves\">2022 European heat waves</a>. We also compare the results to the forecasts from a Gaussian model that predicts the univariate mean and standard deviation of each atmospheric field at each location, a common and computationally efficient but less sophisticated data-driven approach. This Gaussian model is meant to characterize the output of pointwise post-processing, which ignores correlations and treats each grid point as an independent random variable. In contrast, a real weather map would have detailed <em>correlational</em> structures. \n</p>\n<p>\nBecause SEEDS directly models the joint distribution of the atmospheric state, it realistically captures both the spatial covariance and the correlation between mid-tropospheric geopotential and mean sea level pressure, both of which are closely related and are commonly used by weather forecasters for evaluation and verification of forecasts. Gradients in the mean sea level pressure are what drive winds at the surface, while gradients in mid-tropospheric geopotential create upper-level winds that move large-scale weather patterns. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe generated samples from SEEDS shown in the figure below (frames Ca\u2013Ch) display a geopotential trough west of Portugal with spatial structure similar to that found in the operational U.S. forecasts or the reanalysis based on observations. Although the Gaussian model predicts the marginal univariate distributions adequately, it fails to capture cross-field or spatial correlations. This hinders the assessment of the effects that these anomalies may have on hot air intrusions from North Africa, which can exacerbate heat waves over Europe.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQE94TGK404COMAKKxaPwUO9bD8gIzQfu6A0u5c-5xbGKhlUtBW_0KAj-Ur8kpgt5_f-IjAuFzeecpRbbWVujZNQVExTsl0UuDRtOb84Y8uFWc4G1UYYZos6gLVtIHQ3AZ7ojRqoMSmt8IHdTOSx365AaoNyUfNMi1ksC0Wh_axeD_THB6sOmnZZHhrvHQ/s1999/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQE94TGK404COMAKKxaPwUO9bD8gIzQfu6A0u5c-5xbGKhlUtBW_0KAj-Ur8kpgt5_f-IjAuFzeecpRbbWVujZNQVExTsl0UuDRtOb84Y8uFWc4G1UYYZos6gLVtIHQ3AZ7ojRqoMSmt8IHdTOSx365AaoNyUfNMi1ksC0Wh_axeD_THB6sOmnZZHhrvHQ/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Stamp maps over Europe on 2022/07/14 at 0:00 UTC.

Indeed, the event probability computed from a Gaussian kernel density estimate is lower than 1%, which means that ensembles with less than 100 members are unlikely to contain forecasts as extreme as this event. In contrast, the SEEDS ensembles are able to extrapolate from the two seeding forecasts, providing an envelope of possible weather states with much better statistical coverage of the event. This allows both quantifying the probability of the event taking place and sampling weather regimes under which it would occur. Specifically, our highly scalable generative approach enables the creation of very large ensembles that can characterize very rare events by providing samples of weather states exceeding a given threshold for any user-defined diagnostic.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion and future outlook</h2>\n\n<p>\nSEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace. The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version. This leads to a hybrid forecasting system where a few weather trajectories computed with a physics-based model are used to seed a diffusion model that can generate additional forecasts much more efficiently. This methodology provides an alternative to the current operational weather forecasting paradigm, where the computational resources saved by the statistical emulator could be allocated to increasing the resolution of the physics-based model or issuing forecasts more frequently.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe believe that SEEDS represents just one of the many ways that AI will accelerate progress in operational numerical weather prediction in coming years. We hope this demonstration of the  utility of generative AI for weather forecast emulation and post-processing will spur its application in research areas such as climate risk assessment, where generating a large number of ensembles of climate projections is crucial to accurately quantifying the uncertainty about future climate.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n<p>\n<em>All SEEDS authors, Lizao Li, Rob Carver, Ignacio Lopez-Gomez, Fei Sha and John Anderson, co-authored this blog post, with Carla Bromberg as Program Lead.

In contrast, the SEEDS ensembles are able to extrapolate from the two seeding forecasts, providing an envelope of possible weather states with much better statistical coverage of the event. This allows both quantifying the probability of the event taking place and sampling weather regimes under which it would occur. Specifically, our highly scalable generative approach enables the creation of very large ensembles that can characterize very rare events by providing samples of weather states exceeding a given threshold for any user-defined diagnostic.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion and future outlook</h2>\n\n<p>\nSEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace. The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version. This leads to a hybrid forecasting system where a few weather trajectories computed with a physics-based model are used to seed a diffusion model that can generate additional forecasts much more efficiently. This methodology provides an alternative to the current operational weather forecasting paradigm, where the computational resources saved by the statistical emulator could be allocated to increasing the resolution of the physics-based model or issuing forecasts more frequently.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe believe that SEEDS represents just one of the many ways that AI will accelerate progress in operational numerical weather prediction in coming years. We hope this demonstration of the  utility of generative AI for weather forecast emulation and post-processing will spur its application in research areas such as climate risk assessment, where generating a large number of ensembles of climate projections is crucial to accurately quantifying the uncertainty about future climate.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n<p>\n<em>All SEEDS authors, Lizao Li, Rob Carver, Ignacio Lopez-Gomez, Fei Sha and John Anderson, co-authored this blog post, with Carla Bromberg as Program Lead.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Urs K\u00f6ster, Software Engineer, Google Research Time series problems are ubiquitous, from forecasting weather and traffic patterns to understanding economic trends. Bayesian approaches start with an assumption about the data's patterns (prior probability), collecting evidence (e.g., new time series data), and continuously updating that assumption to form a posterior probability distribution. Traditional Bayesian approaches like Gaussian processes (GPs) and Structural Time Series are extensively used for modeling time series data, e.g., the commonly used Mauna Loa CO2 dataset. However, they often rely on domain experts to painstakingly select appropriate model components and may be computationally expensive. Alternatives such as neural networks lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how they generate forecasts, and don't produce reliable confidence intervals. To that end, we introduce AutoBNN, a new open-source package written in JAX. AutoBNN automates the discovery of interpretable time series forecasting models, provides high-quality uncertainty estimates, and scales effectively for use on large datasets. We describe how AutoBNN combines the interpretability of traditional probabilistic approaches with the scalability and flexibility of neural networks. AutoBNN AutoBNN is based on a line of research that over the past decade has yielded improved predictive accuracy by modeling time series using GPs with learned kernel structures. The kernel function of a GP encodes assumptions about the function being modeled, such as the presence of trends, periodicity or noise. With learned GP kernels, the kernel function is defined compositionally: it is either a base kernel (such as Linear, Quadratic, Periodic, Mat\u00e9rn or ExponentiatedQuadratic) or a composite that combines two or more kernel functions using operators such as Addition, Multiplication, or ChangePoint. This compositional kernel structure serves two related purposes. First, it is simple enough that a user who is an expert about their data, but not necessarily about GPs, can construct a reasonable prior for their time series. Second, techniques like Sequential Monte Carlo can be used for discrete searches over small structures and can output interpretable results. AutoBNN improves upon these ideas, replacing the GP with Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) while retaining the compositional kernel structure. A BNN is a neural network with a probability distribution over weights rather than a fixed set of weights. This induces a distribution over outputs, capturing uncertainty in the predictions. BNNs bring the following advantages over GPs: First, training large GPs is computationally expensive, and traditional training algorithms scale as the cube of the number of data points in the time series. In contrast, for a fixed width, training a BNN will often be approximately linear in the number of data points. Second, BNNs lend themselves better to GPU and TPU hardware acceleration than GP training operations. Third, compositional BNNs can be easily combined with traditional deep BNNs, which have the ability to do feature discovery. One could imagine \"hybrid\" architectures, in which users specify a top-level structure of Add(Linear, Periodic, Deep), and the deep BNN is left to learn the contributions from potentially high-dimensional covariate information. How might one translate a GP with compositional kernels into a BNN then? A single layer neural network will typically converge to a GP as the number of neurons (or \"width\") goes to infinity. More recently, researchers have discovered a correspondence in the other direction \u2014 many popular GP kernels (such as Matern, ExponentiatedQuadratic, Polynomial or Periodic) can be obtained as infinite-width BNNs with appropriately chosen activation functions and weight distributions. Furthermore, these BNNs remain close to the corresponding GP even when the width is very much less than infinite. For example, the figures below show the difference in the covariance between pairs of observations, and regression results of the true GPs and their corresponding width-10 neural network versions. Comparison of Gram matrices between true GP kernels (top row) and their width 10 neural network approximations (bottom row). Comparison of regression results between true GP kernels (top row) and their width 10 neural network approximations (bottom row). Finally, the translation is completed with BNN analogues of the Addition and Multiplication operators over GPs, and input warping to produce periodic kernels. BNN addition is straightforwardly given by adding the outputs of the component BNNs. BNN multiplication is achieved by multiplying the activations of the hidden layers of the BNNs and then applying a shared dense layer. We are therefore limited to only multiplying BNNs with the same hidden width. Using AutoBNN The AutoBNN package is available within Tensorflow Probability. It is implemented in JAX and uses the flax.linen neural network library. It implements all of the base kernels and operators discussed so far (Linear, Quadratic, Matern, ExponentiatedQuadratic, Periodic, Addition, Multiplication) plus one new kernel and three new operators: a OneLayer kernel, a single hidden layer ReLU BNN, a ChangePoint operator that allows smoothly switching between two kernels, a LearnableChangePoint operator which is the same as ChangePoint except position and slope are given prior distributions and can be learnt from the data, and a WeightedSum operator. WeightedSum combines two or more BNNs with learnable mixing weights, where the learnable weights follow a Dirichlet prior. By default, a flat Dirichlet distribution with concentration 1.0 is used. WeightedSums allow a \"soft\" version of structure discovery, i.e., training a linear combination of many possible models at once. In contrast to structure discovery with discrete structures, such as in AutoGP, this allows us to use standard gradient methods to learn structures, rather than using expensive discrete optimization. Instead of evaluating potential combinatorial structures in series, WeightedSum allows us to evaluate them in parallel. To easily enable exploration, AutoBNN defines a number of model structures that contain either top-level or internal WeightedSums. The names of these models can be used as the first parameter in any of the estimator constructors, and include things like sum_of_stumps (the WeightedSum over all the base kernels) and sum_of_shallow (which adds all possible combinations of base kernels with all operators). Illustration of the sum_of_stumps model. The bars in the top row show the amount by which each base kernel contributes, and the bottom row shows the function represented by the base kernel. The resulting weighted sum is shown on the right. The figure below demonstrates the technique of structure discovery on the N374 (a time series of yearly financial data starting from 1949) from the M3 dataset. The six base structures were ExponentiatedQuadratic (which is the same as the Radial Basis Function kernel, or RBF for short), Matern, Linear, Quadratic, OneLayer and Periodic kernels. The figure shows the MAP estimates of their weights over an ensemble of 32 particles. All of the high likelihood particles gave a large weight to the Periodic component, low weights to Linear, Quadratic and OneLayer, and a large weight to either RBF or Matern. Parallel coordinates plot of the MAP estimates of the base kernel weights over 32 particles. The sum_of_stumps model was trained on the N374 series from the M3 dataset (insert in blue). Darker lines correspond to particles with higher likelihoods. By using WeightedSums as the inputs to other operators, it is possible to express rich combinatorial structures, while keeping models compact and the number of learnable weights small. As an example, we include the sum_of_products model (illustrated in the figure below) which first creates a pairwise product of two WeightedSums, and then a sum of the two products. By setting some of the weights to zero, we can create many different discrete structures. The total number of possible structures in this model is 216, since there are 16 base kernels that can be turned on or off. All these structures are explored implicitly by training just this one model. Illustration of the \"sum_of_products\" model. Each of the four WeightedSums have the same structure as the \"sum_of_stumps\" model. We have found, however, that certain combinations of kernels (e.g., the product of Periodic and either the Matern or ExponentiatedQuadratic) lead to overfitting on many datasets. To prevent this, we have defined model classes like sum_of_safe_shallow that exclude such products when performing structure discovery with WeightedSums. For training, AutoBNN provides AutoBnnMapEstimator and AutoBnnMCMCEstimator to perform MAP and MCMC inference, respectively. Either estimator can be combined with any of the six likelihood functions, including four based on normal distributions with different noise characteristics for continuous data and two based on the negative binomial distribution for count data. Result from running AutoBNN on the Mauna Loa CO2 dataset in our example colab. The model captures the trend and seasonal component in the data. Extrapolating into the future, the mean prediction slightly underestimates the actual trend, while the 95% confidence interval gradually increases. To fit a model like in the figure above, all it takes is the following 10 lines of code, using the scikit-learn\u2013inspired estimator interface: import autobnn as ab model = ab.operators.Add( bnns=(ab.kernels.PeriodicBNN(width=50), ab.kernels.LinearBNN(width=50), ab.kernels.MaternBNN(width=50))) estimator = ab.estimators.AutoBnnMapEstimator( model, 'normal_likelihood_logistic_noise', jax.random.PRNGKey(42), periods=[12]) estimator.fit(my_training_data_xs, my_training_data_ys) low, mid, high = estimator.predict_quantiles(my_training_data_xs) Conclusion AutoBNN provides a powerful and flexible framework for building sophisticated time series prediction models. By combining the strengths of BNNs and GPs with compositional kernels, AutoBNN opens a world of possibilities for understanding and forecasting complex data. We invite the community to try the colab, and leverage this library to innovate and solve real-world challenges.

Traditional Bayesian approaches like <a href=\"https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/\">Gaussian processes</a> (GPs) and <a href=\"https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/03/structural-time-series-modeling-in.html\">Structural Time Series</a> are extensively used for modeling time series data, e.g., the commonly used <a href=\"https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/\">Mauna Loa CO2</a> dataset. However, they often rely on domain experts to painstakingly select appropriate model components and may be computationally expensive. Alternatives such as neural networks lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how they generate forecasts, and don't produce reliable confidence intervals. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nTo that end, we introduce <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/tree/main/spinoffs/autobnn\">AutoBNN</a>, a new open-source package written in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/jax\">JAX</a>. AutoBNN automates the discovery of interpretable time series forecasting models, provides high-quality uncertainty estimates, and scales effectively for use on large datasets. We describe how AutoBNN combines the interpretability of traditional probabilistic approaches with the scalability and flexibility of neural networks.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>AutoBNN</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nAutoBNN is based on a <a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/duvenaud13.html\">line</a> <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2011.0550\">of</a> <a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saad23a.html\">research</a> that over the past decade has yielded improved predictive accuracy by modeling time series using GPs with learned <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/\">kernel</a> structures. The kernel function of a GP encodes assumptions about the function being modeled, such as the presence of trends, periodicity or noise.  With learned GP kernels, the kernel function is defined compositionally: it is either a base kernel (such as <code>Linear</code>, <code>Quadratic</code>, <code>Periodic</code>, <code><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9rn_covariance_function\">Mat\u00e9rn</a></code> or <code>ExponentiatedQuadratic</code>) or a composite that combines two or more kernel functions using operators such as <code>Addition</code>, <code>Multiplication</code>, or <code><a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2010/papers/170.pdf\">ChangePoint</a></code>. This compositional kernel structure serves two related purposes. First, it is simple enough that a user who is an expert about their data, but not necessarily about GPs, can construct a reasonable prior for their time series. Second, techniques like <a href=\"https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/doucet_defreitas_gordon_smcbookintro.pdf\">Sequential Monte Carlo</a> can be used for discrete searches over small structures and can output interpretable results.</p>\n\n<p>\nAutoBNN improves upon these ideas, replacing the GP with <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/distill_bayes_net/public/\">Bayesian neural networks</a> (BNNs) while retaining the compositional kernel structure. A BNN is a neural network with a probability distribution over weights rather than a fixed set of weights. This induces a distribution over outputs, capturing uncertainty in the predictions. BNNs bring the following advantages over GPs: First, training large GPs is computationally expensive, and traditional training algorithms scale as the cube of the number of data points in the time series. In contrast, for a fixed width, training a BNN will often be approximately linear in the number of data points. Second, BNNs lend themselves better to GPU and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en\">TPU</a> hardware acceleration than GP training operations. Third, compositional BNNs can be easily combined with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06823\">traditional deep BNNs</a>, which have the ability to do feature discovery. One could imagine \"hybrid\" architectures, in which users specify a top-level structure of <code>Add</code>(<code>Linear</code>, <code>Periodic</code>, <code>Deep</code>), and the deep BNN is left to learn the contributions from potentially high-dimensional covariate information.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow might one translate a GP with compositional kernels into a BNN then? A single layer neural network will typically converge to a GP as the number of neurons (or \"width\") <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0745-0_2\">goes to infinity</a>. More recently, researchers have <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=gRwh5HkdaTm\">discovered</a> a correspondence in the other direction \u2014 many popular GP <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/\">kernels</a> (such as <code>Matern</code>, <code>ExponentiatedQuadratic</code>, <code>Polynomial</code> or <code>Periodic</code>) can be obtained as infinite-width BNNs with appropriately chosen activation functions and weight distributions. Furthermore, these BNNs remain close to the corresponding GP even when the width is very much less than infinite. For example, the figures below show the difference in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,of%20a%20given%20random%20vector\">covariance</a> between pairs of observations, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging\">regression</a> results of the true GPs and their corresponding width-10 neural network versions.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHJ7hHI33S76Id3RrWCYezQKky9oELeuWf_CTm7GYadxpV7-B9GSQKCZgTmVQABi9zpWcEK8uvTYITyX2_jcbv_qF-eGv2C1QkU9oDCAS09FfoCne81yEAqC5moTNIqsn05aHfWNr8uy48N3UfV_tRGOyGrrQvB8l7RegzAq5_LNK2W8_Y_gSavdfi5aDI/s1350/image3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHJ7hHI33S76Id3RrWCYezQKky9oELeuWf_CTm7GYadxpV7-B9GSQKCZgTmVQABi9zpWcEK8uvTYITyX2_jcbv_qF-eGv2C1QkU9oDCAS09FfoCne81yEAqC5moTNIqsn05aHfWNr8uy48N3UfV_tRGOyGrrQvB8l7RegzAq5_LNK2W8_Y_gSavdfi5aDI/s16000/image3.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Comparison of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_matrix\">Gram matrices</a> between true GP kernels (top row) and their width 10 neural network approximations (bottom row).</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoidYqlAK2J1n4y71Qn-WuIcmaxGI9ynwSjtHAvyukuY_q5QcX4pVEheX2pwMxIhkAu7_OZR-0s7N7e-cU-caromj1wntP7E1txZfxHqh2yeTedusA90k9hFZ2yvzEZmC2QlPyR7trgVuMro-MoicBxpAbrkQXs2F9h1uux3AXzUENmJ0NA8Ch9dyICT15/s1328/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoidYqlAK2J1n4y71Qn-WuIcmaxGI9ynwSjtHAvyukuY_q5QcX4pVEheX2pwMxIhkAu7_OZR-0s7N7e-cU-caromj1wntP7E1txZfxHqh2yeTedusA90k9hFZ2yvzEZmC2QlPyR7trgVuMro-MoicBxpAbrkQXs2F9h1uux3AXzUENmJ0NA8Ch9dyICT15/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Comparison of regression results between true GP kernels (top row) and their width 10 neural network approximations (bottom row).</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>\nFinally, the translation is completed with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06076\">BNN analogues</a> of the <code>Addition</code> and <code>Multiplication</code> operators over GPs, and input warping to produce periodic kernels.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Atilla Kiraly, Software Engineer, and Rory Pilgrim, Product Manager, Google Research Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally with 1.8 million deaths reported in 2020. Late diagnosis dramatically reduces the chances of survival. Lung cancer screening via computed tomography (CT), which provides a detailed 3D image of the lungs, has been shown to reduce mortality in high-risk populations by at least 20% by detecting potential signs of cancers earlier. In the US, screening involves annual scans, with some countries or cases recommending more or less frequent scans. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently expanded lung cancer screening recommendations by roughly 80%, which is expected to increase screening access for women and racial and ethnic minority groups. However, false positives (i.e., incorrectly reporting a potential cancer in a cancer-free patient) can cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary procedures for patients while increasing costs for the healthcare system. Moreover, efficiency in screening a large number of individuals can be challenging depending on healthcare infrastructure and radiologist availability. At Google we have previously developed machine learning (ML) models for lung cancer detection, and have evaluated their ability to automatically detect and classify regions that show signs of potential cancer. Performance has been shown to be comparable to that of specialists in detecting possible cancer. While they have achieved high performance, effectively communicating findings in realistic environments is necessary to realize their full potential. To that end, in \u201cAssistive AI in Lung Cancer Screening: A Retrospective Multinational Study in the US and Japan\u201d, published in Radiology AI, we investigate how ML models can effectively communicate findings to radiologists. We also introduce a generalizable user-centric interface to help radiologists leverage such models for lung cancer screening. The system takes CT imaging as input and outputs a cancer suspicion rating using four categories (no suspicion, probably benign, suspicious, highly suspicious) along with the corresponding regions of interest. We evaluate the system\u2019s utility in improving clinician performance through randomized reader studies in both the US and Japan, using the local cancer scoring systems (Lung-RADSs V1.1 and Sendai Score) and image viewers that mimic realistic settings. We found that reader specificity increases with model assistance in both reader studies. To accelerate progress in conducting similar studies with ML models, we have open-sourced code to process CT images and generate images compatible with the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) used by radiologists. Developing an interface to communicate model results Integrating ML models into radiologist workflows involves understanding the nuances and goals of their tasks to meaningfully support them. In the case of lung cancer screening, hospitals follow various country-specific guidelines that are regularly updated. For example, in the US, Lung-RADs V1.1 assigns an alpha-numeric score to indicate the lung cancer risk and follow-up recommendations. When assessing patients, radiologists load the CT in their workstation to read the case, find lung nodules or lesions, and apply set guidelines to determine follow-up decisions. Our first step was to improve the previously developed ML models through additional training data and architectural improvements, including self-attention. Then, instead of targeting specific guidelines, we experimented with a complementary way of communicating AI results independent of guidelines or their particular versions. Specifically, the system output offers a suspicion rating and localization (regions of interest) for the user to consider in conjunction with their own specific guidelines. The interface produces output images directly associated with the CT study, requiring no changes to the user\u2019s workstation. The radiologist only needs to review a small set of additional images. There is no other change to their system or interaction with the system. Example of the assistive lung cancer screening system outputs. Results for the radiologist\u2019s evaluation are visualized on the location of the CT volume where the suspicious lesion is found. The overall suspicion is displayed at the top of the CT images. Circles highlight the suspicious lesions while squares show a rendering of the same lesion from a different perspective, called a sagittal view. The assistive lung cancer screening system comprises 13 models and has a high-level architecture similar to the end-to-end system used in prior work. The models coordinate with each other to first segment the lungs, obtain an overall assessment, locate three suspicious regions, then use the information to assign a suspicion rating to each region. The system was deployed on Google Cloud using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that pulled the images, ran the ML models, and provided results. This allows scalability and directly connects to servers where the images are stored in DICOM stores. Outline of the Google Cloud deployment of the assistive lung cancer screening system and the directional calling flow for the individual components that serve the images and compute results. Images are served to the viewer and to the system using Google Cloud services. The system is run on a Google Kubernetes Engine that pulls the images, processes them, and writes them back into the DICOM store. Reader studies To evaluate the system\u2019s utility in improving clinical performance, we conducted two reader studies (i.e., experiments designed to assess clinical performance comparing expert performance with and without the aid of a technology) with 12 radiologists using pre-existing, de-identified CT scans. We presented 627 challenging cases to 6 US-based and 6 Japan-based radiologists. In the experimental setup, readers were divided into two groups that read each case twice, with and without assistance from the model. Readers were asked to apply scoring guidelines they typically use in their clinical practice and report their overall suspicion of cancer for each case. We then compared the results of the reader\u2019s responses to measure the impact of the model on their workflow and decisions. The score and suspicion level were judged against the actual cancer outcomes of the individuals to measure sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. These were compared with and without assistance. A multi-case multi-reader study involves each case being reviewed by each reader twice, once with ML system assistance and once without. In this visualization one reader first reviews Set A without assistance (blue) and then with assistance (orange) after a wash-out period. A second reader group follows the opposite path by reading the same set of cases Set A with assistance first. Readers are randomized to these groups to remove the effect of ordering. The ability to conduct these studies using the same interface highlights its generalizability to completely different cancer scoring systems, and the generalization of the model and assistive capability to different patient populations. Our study results demonstrated that when radiologists used the system in their clinical evaluation, they had an increased ability to correctly identify lung images without actionable lung cancer findings (i.e., specificity) by an absolute 5\u20137% compared to when they didn\u2019t use the assistive system. This potentially means that for every 15\u201320 patients screened, one may be able to avoid unnecessary follow-up procedures, thus reducing their anxiety and the burden on the health care system. This can, in turn, help improve the sustainability of lung cancer screening programs, particularly as more people become eligible for screening. Reader specificity increases with ML model assistance in both the US-based and Japan-based reader studies. Specificity values were derived from reader scores from actionable findings (something suspicious was found) versus no actionable findings, compared against the true cancer outcome of the individual. Under model assistance, readers flagged fewer cancer-negative individuals for follow-up visits. Sensitivity for cancer positive individuals remained the same. Translating this into real-world impact through partnership The system results demonstrate the potential for fewer follow-up visits, reduced anxiety, as well lower overall costs for lung cancer screening. In an effort to translate this research into real-world clinical impact, we are working with: DeepHealth, a leading AI-powered health informatics provider; and Apollo Radiology International a leading provider of Radiology services in India to explore paths for incorporating this system into future products. In addition, we are looking to help other researchers studying how best to integrate ML model results into clinical workflows by open sourcing code used for the reader study and incorporating the insights described in this blog. We hope that this will help accelerate medical imaging researchers looking to conduct reader studies for their AI models, and catalyze translational research in the field.

Late diagnosis dramatically reduces the chances of survival. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/screening.htm\">Lung cancer screening</a> via <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/ct-scans-fact-sheet#:~:text=indicate%20real%20problems.-,Lung%20cancer,-Low%2Ddose%20CT\">computed tomography</a> (CT), which provides a detailed 3D image of the lungs, has been shown to reduce mortality in high-risk populations by at least 20% by detecting potential signs of cancers earlier. In the US, screening involves annual scans, with some countries or cases recommending more or less frequent scans. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/lung-cancer-screening\">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> recently expanded lung cancer screening recommendations by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34636916/\">roughly 80%</a>, which is expected to increase screening access for women and racial and ethnic minority groups. However, false positives (i.e., incorrectly reporting a potential cancer in a cancer-free patient) can cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary procedures for patients while increasing costs for the healthcare system. Moreover, efficiency in screening a large number of individuals can be challenging depending on healthcare infrastructure and radiologist availability.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nAt Google we have previously developed <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/health/lung-cancer-prediction/\">machine learning (ML) models for lung cancer detection</a>, and have evaluated their ability to automatically detect and classify regions that show signs of potential cancer. Performance has been shown to be comparable to that of specialists in detecting possible cancer. While they have achieved high performance, effectively communicating findings in realistic environments is necessary to realize their full potential.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.230079\">Assistive AI in Lung Cancer Screening: A Retrospective Multinational Study in the US and Japan</a>\u201d, published in <em><a href=\"https://pubs.rsna.org/journal/ai\">Radiology AI</a></em>, we investigate how ML models can effectively communicate findings to radiologists. We also introduce a generalizable user-centric interface to help radiologists leverage such models for lung cancer screening. The system takes CT imaging as input and outputs a cancer suspicion rating using four categories (no suspicion, probably benign, suspicious, highly suspicious) along with the corresponding regions of interest. We evaluate the system\u2019s utility in improving clinician performance through randomized reader studies in both the US and Japan, using the local cancer scoring systems (<a href=\"https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RADS/Lung-RADS/LungRADSAssessmentCategoriesv1-1.pdf\">Lung-RADSs V1.1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jscts.org/pdf/guideline/gls3rdfig_english130621.pdf\">Sendai Score</a>) and image viewers that mimic realistic settings. We found that reader specificity increases with model assistance in both reader studies. To accelerate progress in conducting similar studies with ML models, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/Google-Health/google-health/tree/master/ct_dicom\">open-sourced code</a> to process CT images and generate images compatible with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system\">picture archiving and communication system</a> (PACS) used by radiologists. \n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Developing an interface to communicate model results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nIntegrating ML models into radiologist workflows involves understanding the nuances and goals of their tasks to meaningfully support them. In the case of lung cancer screening, hospitals follow various country-specific guidelines that are regularly updated. For example, in the US, Lung-RADs V1.1 assigns an <a href=\"https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RADS/Lung-RADS/LungRADSAssessmentCategoriesv1-1.pdf\">alpha-numeric score</a> to indicate the lung cancer risk and follow-up recommendations<em>. </em>When assessing patients, radiologists load the CT in their workstation to read the case, find lung nodules or lesions, and apply set guidelines to determine follow-up decisions. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nOur first step was to improve the <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/health/lung-cancer-prediction/\">previously developed ML models</a> through additional training data and architectural improvements, including <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/attention-is-all-you-need/\">self-attention</a>. Then, instead of targeting specific guidelines, we experimented with a complementary way of communicating AI results independent of guidelines or their particular versions. Specifically, the system output offers a suspicion rating and localization (regions of interest) for the user to consider in conjunction with their own specific guidelines. The interface produces output images directly associated with the CT study, requiring no changes to the user\u2019s workstation. The radiologist only needs to review a small set of additional images. There is no other change to their system or interaction with the system.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n</p><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiChGqKLOWQAzrIzk294q6i6XuUoR1ul0qoTAR8RHQw-bZT-ulyruug-HNY8f2em7ZgzHE1UP6yQbe4plM0gkmXu6KwcTmsNogbr6FjTGzSDrBEDFhVLQ4TdbxVp_bbB21gA_jR84-1r9ly-O5HXqOzuZERgJyjFSYtZty7h6J3UErWsP0-DoQ1pFZtyjiw/s857/image1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiChGqKLOWQAzrIzk294q6i6XuUoR1ul0qoTAR8RHQw-bZT-ulyruug-HNY8f2em7ZgzHE1UP6yQbe4plM0gkmXu6KwcTmsNogbr6FjTGzSDrBEDFhVLQ4TdbxVp_bbB21gA_jR84-1r9ly-O5HXqOzuZERgJyjFSYtZty7h6J3UErWsP0-DoQ1pFZtyjiw/s16000/image1.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Example of the assistive lung cancer screening system outputs.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Yossi Matias, VP Engineering & Research, and Grey Nearing, Research Scientist, Google Research Floods are the most common natural disaster, and are responsible for roughly $50 billion in annual financial damages worldwide. The rate of flood-related disasters has more than doubled since the year 2000 partly due to climate change. Nearly 1.5 billion people, making up 19% of the world\u2019s population, are exposed to substantial risks from severe flood events. Upgrading early warning systems to make accurate and timely information accessible to these populations can save thousands of lives per year. Driven by the potential impact of reliable flood forecasting on people\u2019s lives globally, we started our flood forecasting effort in 2017. Through this multi-year journey, we advanced research over the years hand-in-hand with building a real-time operational flood forecasting system that provides alerts on Google Search, Maps, Android notifications and through the Flood Hub. However, in order to scale globally, especially in places where accurate local data is not available, more research advances were required. In \u201cGlobal prediction of extreme floods in ungauged watersheds\u201d, published in Nature, we demonstrate how machine learning (ML) technologies can significantly improve global-scale flood forecasting relative to the current state-of-the-art for countries where flood-related data is scarce. With these AI-based technologies we extended the reliability of currently-available global nowcasts, on average, from zero to five days, and improved forecasts across regions in Africa and Asia to be similar to what are currently available in Europe. The evaluation of the models was conducted in collaboration with the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). These technologies also enable Flood Hub to provide real-time river forecasts up to seven days in advance, covering river reaches across over 80 countries. This information can be used by people, communities, governments and international organizations to take anticipatory action to help protect vulnerable populations. Flood forecasting at Google The ML models that power the FloodHub tool are the product of many years of research, conducted in collaboration with several partners, including academics, governments, international organizations, and NGOs. In 2018, we launched a pilot early warning system in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river basin in India, with the hypothesis that ML could help address the challenging problem of reliable flood forecasting at scale. The pilot was further expanded the following year via the combination of an inundation model, real-time water level measurements, the creation of an elevation map and hydrologic modeling. In collaboration with academics, and, in particular, with the JKU Institute for Machine Learning we explored ML-based hydrologic models, showing that LSTM-based models could produce more accurate simulations than traditional conceptual and physics-based hydrology models. This research led to flood forecasting improvements that enabled the expansion of our forecasting coverage to include all of India and Bangladesh. We also worked with researchers at Yale University to test technological interventions that increase the reach and impact of flood warnings. Our hydrological models predict river floods by processing publicly available weather data like precipitation and physical watershed information. Such models must be calibrated to long data records from streamflow gauging stations in individual rivers. A low percentage of global river watersheds (basins) have streamflow gauges, which are expensive but necessary to supply relevant data, and it\u2019s challenging for hydrological simulation and forecasting to provide predictions in basins that lack this infrastructure. Lower gross domestic product (GDP) is correlated with increased vulnerability to flood risks, and there is an inverse correlation between national GDP and the amount of publicly available data in a country. ML helps to address this problem by allowing a single model to be trained on all available river data and to be applied to ungauged basins where no data are available. In this way, models can be trained globally, and can make predictions for any river location. There is an inverse (log-log) correlation between the amount of publicly available streamflow data in a country and national GDP. Streamflow data from the Global Runoff Data Center. Our academic collaborations led to ML research that developed methods to estimate uncertainty in river forecasts and showed how ML river forecast models synthesize information from multiple data sources. They demonstrated that these models can simulate extreme events reliably, even when those events are not part of the training data. In an effort to contribute to open science, in 2023 we open-sourced a community-driven dataset for large-sample hydrology in Nature Scientific Data. The river forecast model Most hydrology models used by national and international agencies for flood forecasting and river modeling are state-space models, which depend only on daily inputs (e.g., precipitation, temperature, etc.) and the current state of the system (e.g., soil moisture, snowpack, etc.). LSTMs are a variant of state-space models and work by defining a neural network that represents a single time step, where input data (such as current weather conditions) are processed to produce updated state information and output values (streamflow) for that time step. LSTMs are applied sequentially to make time-series predictions, and in this sense, behave similarly to how scientists typically conceptualize hydrologic systems. Empirically, we have found that LSTMs perform well on the task of river forecasting. A diagram of the LSTM, which is a neural network that operates sequentially in time. An accessible primer can be found here. Our river forecast model uses two LSTMs applied sequentially: (1) a \u201chindcast\u201d LSTM ingests historical weather data (dynamic hindcast features) up to the present time (or rather, the issue time of a forecast), and (2) a \u201cforecast\u201d LSTM ingests states from the hindcast LSTM along with forecasted weather data (dynamic forecast features) to make future predictions. One year of historical weather data are input into the hindcast LSTM, and seven days of forecasted weather data are input into the forecast LSTM. Static features include geographical and geophysical characteristics of watersheds that are input into both the hindcast and forecast LSTMs and allow the model to learn different hydrological behaviors and responses in various types of watersheds. Output from the forecast LSTM is fed into a \u201chead\u201d layer that uses mixture density networks to produce a probabilistic forecast (i.e., predicted parameters of a probability distribution over streamflow). Specifically, the model predicts the parameters of a mixture of heavy-tailed probability density functions, called asymmetric Laplacian distributions, at each forecast time step. The result is a mixture density function, called a Countable Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians (CMAL) distribution, which represents a probabilistic prediction of the volumetric flow rate in a particular river at a particular time. LSTM-based river forecast model architecture. Two LSTMs are applied in sequence, one ingesting historical weather data and one ingesting forecasted weather data. The model outputs are the parameters of a probability distribution over streamflow at each forecasted timestep. Input and training data The model uses three types of publicly available data inputs, mostly from governmental sources: Static watershed attributes representing geographical and geophysical variables: From the HydroATLAS project, including data like long-term climate indexes (precipitation, temperature, snow fractions), land cover, and anthropogenic attributes (e.g., a nighttime lights index as a proxy for human development). Historical meteorological time-series data: Used to spin up the model for one year prior to the issue time of a forecast. The data comes from NASA IMERG, NOAA CPC Global Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation, and the ECMWF ERA5-land reanalysis. Variables include daily total precipitation, air temperature, solar and thermal radiation, snowfall, and surface pressure. Forecasted meteorological time series over a seven-day forecast horizon: Used as input for the forecast LSTM. These data are the same meteorological variables listed above, and come from the ECMWF HRES atmospheric model. Training data are daily streamflow values from the Global Runoff Data Center over the time period 1980 - 2023. A single streamflow forecast model is trained using data from 5,680 diverse watershed streamflow gauges (shown below) to improve accuracy. Location of 5,680 streamflow gauges that supply training data for the river forecast model from the Global Runoff Data Center. Improving on the current state-of-the-art We compared our river forecast model with GloFAS version 4, the current state-of-the-art global flood forecasting system. These experiments showed that ML can provide accurate warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events. The figure below shows the distribution of F1 scores when predicting different severity events at river locations around the world, with plus or minus 1 day accuracy. F1 scores are an average of precision and recall and event severity is measured by return period. For example, a 2-year return period event is a volume of streamflow that is expected to be exceeded on average once every two years. Our model achieves reliability scores at up to 4-day or 5-day lead times that are similar to or better, on average, than the reliability of GloFAS nowcasts (0-day lead time). Distributions of F1 scores over 2-year return period events in 2,092 watersheds globally during the time period 2014-2023 from GloFAS (blue) and our model (orange) at different lead times. On average, our model is statistically as accurate as GloFAS nowcasts (0\u2013day lead time) up to 5 days in advance over 2-year (shown) and 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year events (not shown). Additionally (not shown), our model achieves accuracies over larger and rarer extreme events, with precision and recall scores over 5-year return period events that are similar to or better than GloFAS accuracies over 1-year return period events. See the paper for more information. Looking into the future The flood forecasting initiative is part of our Adaptation and Resilience efforts and reflects Google's commitment to address climate change while helping global communities become more resilient. We believe that AI and ML will continue to play a critical role in helping advance science and research towards climate action. We actively collaborate with several international aid organizations (e.g., the Centre for Humanitarian Data and the Red Cross) to provide actionable flood forecasts. Additionally, in an ongoing collaboration with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to support early warning systems for climate hazards, we are conducting a study to help understand how AI can help address real-world challenges faced by national flood forecasting agencies. While the work presented here demonstrates a significant step forward in flood forecasting, future work is needed to further expand flood forecasting coverage to more locations globally and other types of flood-related events and disasters, including flash floods and urban floods. We are looking forward to continuing collaborations with our partners in the academic and expert communities, local governments and the industry to reach these goals.",

However, in order to <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/flood-hub-ai-flood-forecasting-more-countries/\">scale globally</a>, especially in places where accurate local data is not available, more research advances were required.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07145-1\">Global prediction of extreme floods in ungauged watersheds</a>\u201d, published in <em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/\">Nature</a></em>, we demonstrate how machine learning (ML) technologies can significantly improve global-scale <a href=\"https://sites.research.google/floodforecasting/\">flood forecasting</a> relative to the current state-of-the-art for countries where flood-related data is scarce. With these AI-based technologies we extended the reliability of currently-available global nowcasts, on average, from zero to five days, and improved forecasts across regions in Africa and Asia to be similar to what are currently available in Europe.

Such models must be calibrated to long data records from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_gauge\">streamflow gauging stations</a> in individual rivers. A low percentage of global river watersheds (basins) have streamflow gauges, which are expensive but necessary to supply relevant data, and it\u2019s challenging for hydrological simulation and forecasting to provide <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2013.803183\">predictions in basins</a> that lack this infrastructure.

Such models must be calibrated to long data records from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_gauge\">streamflow gauging stations</a> in individual rivers. A low percentage of global river watersheds (basins) have streamflow gauges, which are expensive but necessary to supply relevant data, and it\u2019s challenging for hydrological simulation and forecasting to provide <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2013.803183\">predictions in basins</a> that lack this infrastructure.

      "summary": "Google Research introduces ScreenAI, an advanced vision-language model designed to understand and interact effectively with visual elements in user interfaces (UIs) and infographics.",
      "summary_original": "Posted by Srinivas Sunkara and Gilles Baechler, Software Engineers, Google Research Screen user interfaces (UIs) and infographics, such as charts, diagrams and tables, play important roles in human communication and human-machine interaction as they facilitate rich and interactive user experiences. UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge. To that end, we introduce \u201cScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding\u201d. ScreenAI improves upon the PaLI architecture with the flexible patching strategy from pix2struct. We train ScreenAI on a unique mixture of datasets and tasks, including a novel Screen Annotation task that requires the model to identify UI element information (i.e., type, location and description) on a screen. These text annotations provide large language models (LLMs) with screen descriptions, enabling them to automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves state-of-the-art results on UI- and infographic-based tasks (WebSRC and MoTIF), and best-in-class performance on Chart QA, DocVQA, and InfographicVQA compared to models of similar size. We are also releasing three new datasets: Screen Annotation to evaluate the layout understanding capability of the model, as well as ScreenQA Short and Complex ScreenQA for a more comprehensive evaluation of its QA capability. ScreenAI ScreenAI\u2019s architecture is based on PaLI, composed of a multimodal encoder block and an autoregressive decoder. The PaLI encoder uses a vision transformer (ViT) that creates image embeddings and a multimodal encoder that takes the concatenation of the image and text embeddings as input. This flexible architecture allows ScreenAI to solve vision tasks that can be recast as text+image-to-text problems. On top of the PaLI architecture, we employ a flexible patching strategy introduced in pix2struct. Instead of using a fixed-grid pattern, the grid dimensions are selected such that they preserve the native aspect ratio of the input image. This enables ScreenAI to work well across images of various aspect ratios. The ScreenAI model is trained in two stages: a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. First, self-supervised learning is applied to automatically generate data labels, which are then used to train ViT and the language model. ViT is frozen during the fine-tuning stage, where most data used is manually labeled by human raters. ScreenAI model architecture. Data generation To create a pre-training dataset for ScreenAI, we first compile an extensive collection of screenshots from various devices, including desktops, mobile, and tablets. This is achieved by using publicly accessible web pages and following the programmatic exploration approach used for the RICO dataset for mobile apps. We then apply a layout annotator, based on the DETR model, that identifies and labels a wide range of UI elements (e.g., image, pictogram, button, text) and their spatial relationships. Pictograms undergo further analysis using an icon classifier capable of distinguishing 77 different icon types. This detailed classification is essential for interpreting the subtle information conveyed through icons. For icons that are not covered by the classifier, and for infographics and images, we use the PaLI image captioning model to generate descriptive captions that provide contextual information. We also apply an optical character recognition (OCR) engine to extract and annotate textual content on screen. We combine the OCR text with the previous annotations to create a detailed description of each screen. A mobile app screenshot with generated annotations that include UI elements and their descriptions, e.g., TEXT elements also contain the text content from OCR, IMAGE elements contain image captions, LIST_ITEMs contain all their child elements. LLM-based data generation We enhance the pre-training data's diversity using PaLM 2 to generate input-output pairs in a two-step process. First, screen annotations are generated using the technique outlined above, then we craft a prompt around this schema for the LLM to create synthetic data. This process requires prompt engineering and iterative refinement to find an effective prompt. We assess the generated data's quality through human validation against a quality threshold. You only speak JSON. Do not write text that isn\u2019t JSON. You are given the following mobile screenshot, described in words. Can you generate 5 questions regarding the content of the screenshot as well as the corresponding short answers to them? The answer should be as short as possible, containing only the necessary information. Your answer should be structured as follows: questions: [ {{question: the question, answer: the answer }}, ... ] {THE SCREEN SCHEMA} A sample prompt for QA data generation. By combining the natural language capabilities of LLMs with a structured schema, we simulate a wide range of user interactions and scenarios to generate synthetic, realistic tasks. In particular, we generate three categories of tasks: Question answering: The model is asked to answer questions regarding the content of the screenshots, e.g., \u201cWhen does the restaurant open?\u201d Screen navigation: The model is asked to convert a natural language utterance into an executable action on a screen, e.g., \u201cClick the search button.\u201d Screen summarization: The model is asked to summarize the screen content in one or two sentences. Block diagram of our workflow for generating data for QA, summarization and navigation tasks using existing ScreenAI models and LLMs. Each task uses a custom prompt to emphasize desired aspects, like questions related to counting, involving reasoning, etc. LLM-generated data. Examples for screen QA, navigation and summarization. For navigation, the action bounding box is displayed in red on the screenshot. Experiments and results As previously mentioned, ScreenAI is trained in two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training data labels are obtained using self-supervised learning and fine-tuning data labels comes from human raters. We fine-tune ScreenAI using public QA, summarization, and navigation datasets and a variety of tasks related to UIs. For QA, we use well established benchmarks in the multimodal and document understanding field, such as ChartQA, DocVQA, Multi page DocVQA, InfographicVQA, OCR VQA, Web SRC and ScreenQA. For navigation, datasets used include Referring Expressions, MoTIF, Mug, and Android in the Wild. Finally, we use Screen2Words for screen summarization and Widget Captioning for describing specific UI elements. Along with the fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate the fine-tuned ScreenAI model using three novel benchmarks: Screen Annotation: Enables the evaluation model layout annotations and spatial understanding capabilities. ScreenQA Short: A variation of ScreenQA, where its ground truth answers have been shortened to contain only the relevant information that better aligns with other QA tasks. Complex ScreenQA: Complements ScreenQA Short with more difficult questions (counting, arithmetic, comparison, and non-answerable questions) and contains screens with various aspect ratios. The fine-tuned ScreenAI model achieves state-of-the-art results on various UI and infographic-based tasks (WebSRC and MoTIF) and best-in-class performance on Chart QA, DocVQA, and InfographicVQA compared to models of similar size. ScreenAI achieves competitive performance on Screen2Words and OCR-VQA. Additionally, we report results on the new benchmark datasets introduced to serve as a baseline for further research. Comparing model performance of ScreenAI with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models of similar size. Next, we examine ScreenAI\u2019s scaling capabilities and observe that across all tasks, increasing the model size improves performances and the improvements have not saturated at the largest size. Model performance increases with size, and the performance has not saturated even at the largest size of 5B params. Conclusion We introduce the ScreenAI model along with a unified representation that enables us to develop self-supervised learning tasks leveraging data from all these domains. We also illustrate the impact of data generation using LLMs and investigate improving model performance on specific aspects with modifying the training mixture. We apply all of these techniques to build multi-task trained models that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches on a number of public benchmarks. However, we also note that our approach still lags behind large models and further research is needed to bridge this gap.

UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nTo that end, we introduce \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615\">ScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding</a>\u201d. ScreenAI improves upon the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565\">PaLI architecture</a> with the flexible patching strategy from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347\">pix2struct</a>. We train ScreenAI on a unique mixture of datasets and tasks, including a novel Screen Annotation task that requires the model to identify UI element information (i.e., type, location and description) on a screen. These text annotations provide large language models (LLMs) with screen descriptions, enabling them to automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves state-of-the-art results on UI- and infographic-based tasks (<a href=\"https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/\">WebSRC</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aburns4/MoTIF\">MoTIF</a>), and best-in-class performance on <a href=\"https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA\">Chart QA</a>, <a href=\"https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17&amp;com=evaluation&amp;task=1\">DocVQA</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12756\">InfographicVQA</a> compared to models of similar size. We are also releasing three new datasets: <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#screen-annotation-dataset-details\">Screen Annotation</a> to evaluate the layout understanding capability of the model, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#short_answers-directory\">ScreenQA Short</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#complexqa\" target=\"_blank\">Complex ScreenQA</a> for a more comprehensive evaluation of its QA capability. \n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>ScreenAI</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nScreenAI\u2019s architecture is based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794\">PaLI</a>, composed of a multimodal encoder block and an autoregressive decoder. The PaLI encoder uses a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929\">vision transformer</a> (ViT) that creates image embeddings and a multimodal encoder that takes the concatenation of the image and text embeddings as input. This flexible architecture allows ScreenAI to solve vision tasks that can be recast as text+image-to-text problems. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn top of the PaLI architecture, we employ a flexible patching strategy introduced in pix2struct. Instead of using a fixed-grid pattern, the grid dimensions are selected such that they preserve the native aspect ratio of the input image. This enables ScreenAI to work well across images of various aspect ratios. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ScreenAI model is trained in two stages: a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. First, self-supervised learning is applied to automatically generate data labels, which are then used to train ViT and the language model. ViT is frozen during the fine-tuning stage, where most data used is manually labeled by human raters. \n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s1600/image6.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s16000/image6.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">ScreenAI model architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Data generation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo create a pre-training dataset for ScreenAI, we first compile an extensive collection of screenshots from various devices, including desktops, mobile, and tablets. This is achieved by using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683\" target=\"_blank\">publicly accessible web pages</a> and following the programmatic exploration approach used for the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3126594.3126651\" target=\"_blank\">RICO dataset</a> for mobile apps. We then apply a layout annotator, based on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872\" target=\"_blank\">DETR</a> model, that identifies and labels a wide range of UI elements (e.g., image, pictogram, button, text) and their spatial relationships. Pictograms undergo further analysis using an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02663\" target=\"_blank\">icon classifier</a> capable of distinguishing 77 different icon types. This detailed classification is essential for interpreting the subtle information conveyed through icons. For icons that are not covered by the classifier, and for infographics and images, we use the PaLI image captioning model to generate descriptive captions that provide contextual information. We also apply an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ocr\" target=\"_blank\">optical character recognition</a> (OCR) engine to extract and annotate textual content on screen.

UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nTo that end, we introduce \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615\">ScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding</a>\u201d. ScreenAI improves upon the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565\">PaLI architecture</a> with the flexible patching strategy from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347\">pix2struct</a>. We train ScreenAI on a unique mixture of datasets and tasks, including a novel Screen Annotation task that requires the model to identify UI element information (i.e., type, location and description) on a screen. These text annotations provide large language models (LLMs) with screen descriptions, enabling them to automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves state-of-the-art results on UI- and infographic-based tasks (<a href=\"https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/\">WebSRC</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aburns4/MoTIF\">MoTIF</a>), and best-in-class performance on <a href=\"https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA\">Chart QA</a>, <a href=\"https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17&amp;com=evaluation&amp;task=1\">DocVQA</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12756\">InfographicVQA</a> compared to models of similar size. We are also releasing three new datasets: <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#screen-annotation-dataset-details\">Screen Annotation</a> to evaluate the layout understanding capability of the model, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#short_answers-directory\">ScreenQA Short</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#complexqa\" target=\"_blank\">Complex ScreenQA</a> for a more comprehensive evaluation of its QA capability. \n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>ScreenAI</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nScreenAI\u2019s architecture is based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794\">PaLI</a>, composed of a multimodal encoder block and an autoregressive decoder. The PaLI encoder uses a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929\">vision transformer</a> (ViT) that creates image embeddings and a multimodal encoder that takes the concatenation of the image and text embeddings as input. This flexible architecture allows ScreenAI to solve vision tasks that can be recast as text+image-to-text problems. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn top of the PaLI architecture, we employ a flexible patching strategy introduced in pix2struct. Instead of using a fixed-grid pattern, the grid dimensions are selected such that they preserve the native aspect ratio of the input image. This enables ScreenAI to work well across images of various aspect ratios. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ScreenAI model is trained in two stages: a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. First, self-supervised learning is applied to automatically generate data labels, which are then used to train ViT and the language model. ViT is frozen during the fine-tuning stage, where most data used is manually labeled by human raters. \n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s1600/image6.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s16000/image6.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">ScreenAI model architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Data generation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo create a pre-training dataset for ScreenAI, we first compile an extensive collection of screenshots from various devices, including desktops, mobile, and tablets. This is achieved by using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683\" target=\"_blank\">publicly accessible web pages</a> and following the programmatic exploration approach used for the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3126594.3126651\" target=\"_blank\">RICO dataset</a> for mobile apps. We then apply a layout annotator, based on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872\" target=\"_blank\">DETR</a> model, that identifies and labels a wide range of UI elements (e.g., image, pictogram, button, text) and their spatial relationships. Pictograms undergo further analysis using an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02663\" target=\"_blank\">icon classifier</a> capable of distinguishing 77 different icon types. This detailed classification is essential for interpreting the subtle information conveyed through icons. For icons that are not covered by the classifier, and for infographics and images, we use the PaLI image captioning model to generate descriptive captions that provide contextual information. We also apply an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ocr\" target=\"_blank\">optical character recognition</a> (OCR) engine to extract and annotate textual content on screen. We combine the OCR text with the previous annotations to create a detailed description of each screen.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_wzxsb1U_PH17m3dG92ny7PpJjIYK39k1NQme1i5GM63tAd_OGdxMAV2_OQQVQSdkdyY1Tb3s8ibI2M3Kp1VpdNMsBr0ugBcBdL_r6dUwOwdfJfBMn3ae9Zl3zM2IpfZV654DFybMhMLimy0cuUNsnU5L8O2byu9eHmhdWcIvsb1t8AWi-tKNkXFq7Neo/s1747/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_wzxsb1U_PH17m3dG92ny7PpJjIYK39k1NQme1i5GM63tAd_OGdxMAV2_OQQVQSdkdyY1Tb3s8ibI2M3Kp1VpdNMsBr0ugBcBdL_r6dUwOwdfJfBMn3ae9Zl3zM2IpfZV654DFybMhMLimy0cuUNsnU5L8O2byu9eHmhdWcIvsb1t8AWi-tKNkXFq7Neo/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A mobile app screenshot with generated annotations that include UI elements and their descriptions, e.g., <code>TEXT</code> elements also contain the text content from OCR, <code>IMAGE</code> elements contain image captions, <code>LIST_ITEMs</code> contain all their child elements.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br />\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>LLM-based data generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWe enhance the pre-training data's diversity using <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/\">PaLM 2</a> to generate input-output pairs in a two-step process.

UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nTo that end, we introduce \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615\">ScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding</a>\u201d. ScreenAI improves upon the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565\">PaLI architecture</a> with the flexible patching strategy from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347\">pix2struct</a>. We train ScreenAI on a unique mixture of datasets and tasks, including a novel Screen Annotation task that requires the model to identify UI element information (i.e., type, location and description) on a screen. These text annotations provide large language models (LLMs) with screen descriptions, enabling them to automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves state-of-the-art results on UI- and infographic-based tasks (<a href=\"https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/\">WebSRC</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aburns4/MoTIF\">MoTIF</a>), and best-in-class performance on <a href=\"https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA\">Chart QA</a>, <a href=\"https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17&amp;com=evaluation&amp;task=1\">DocVQA</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12756\">InfographicVQA</a> compared to models of similar size. We are also releasing three new datasets: <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#screen-annotation-dataset-details\">Screen Annotation</a> to evaluate the layout understanding capability of the model, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#short_answers-directory\">ScreenQA Short</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/screen_qa?tab=readme-ov-file#complexqa\" target=\"_blank\">Complex ScreenQA</a> for a more comprehensive evaluation of its QA capability. \n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>ScreenAI</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nScreenAI\u2019s architecture is based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794\">PaLI</a>, composed of a multimodal encoder block and an autoregressive decoder. The PaLI encoder uses a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929\">vision transformer</a> (ViT) that creates image embeddings and a multimodal encoder that takes the concatenation of the image and text embeddings as input. This flexible architecture allows ScreenAI to solve vision tasks that can be recast as text+image-to-text problems. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn top of the PaLI architecture, we employ a flexible patching strategy introduced in pix2struct. Instead of using a fixed-grid pattern, the grid dimensions are selected such that they preserve the native aspect ratio of the input image. This enables ScreenAI to work well across images of various aspect ratios. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ScreenAI model is trained in two stages: a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. First, self-supervised learning is applied to automatically generate data labels, which are then used to train ViT and the language model. ViT is frozen during the fine-tuning stage, where most data used is manually labeled by human raters. \n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s1600/image6.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjS1qatfLUw6BZZgkPxrv0Hx1pAPAehiF8q3kfA0BUyyPx4XXpwZRr75nYl99fTIQwLNmOHXhSBbpzHDnw6yQXZls1ZV-IE-d75jP5M02cRSZTYuU8FJBS4mubPzUPIuvcj_oqkEJcWtNWtnLmPZ3P1jJlDmc8GA1WNq00jUwl2o8gfLIIXlknrjy4z6y7Y/s16000/image6.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">ScreenAI model architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Data generation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo create a pre-training dataset for ScreenAI, we first compile an extensive collection of screenshots from various devices, including desktops, mobile, and tablets. This is achieved by using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683\" target=\"_blank\">publicly accessible web pages</a> and following the programmatic exploration approach used for the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3126594.3126651\" target=\"_blank\">RICO dataset</a> for mobile apps. We then apply a layout annotator, based on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872\" target=\"_blank\">DETR</a> model, that identifies and labels a wide range of UI elements (e.g., image, pictogram, button, text) and their spatial relationships. Pictograms undergo further analysis using an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02663\" target=\"_blank\">icon classifier</a> capable of distinguishing 77 different icon types. This detailed classification is essential for interpreting the subtle information conveyed through icons. For icons that are not covered by the classifier, and for infographics and images, we use the PaLI image captioning model to generate descriptive captions that provide contextual information. We also apply an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ocr\" target=\"_blank\">optical character recognition</a> (OCR) engine to extract and annotate textual content on screen. We combine the OCR text with the previous annotations to create a detailed description of each screen.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_wzxsb1U_PH17m3dG92ny7PpJjIYK39k1NQme1i5GM63tAd_OGdxMAV2_OQQVQSdkdyY1Tb3s8ibI2M3Kp1VpdNMsBr0ugBcBdL_r6dUwOwdfJfBMn3ae9Zl3zM2IpfZV654DFybMhMLimy0cuUNsnU5L8O2byu9eHmhdWcIvsb1t8AWi-tKNkXFq7Neo/s1747/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_wzxsb1U_PH17m3dG92ny7PpJjIYK39k1NQme1i5GM63tAd_OGdxMAV2_OQQVQSdkdyY1Tb3s8ibI2M3Kp1VpdNMsBr0ugBcBdL_r6dUwOwdfJfBMn3ae9Zl3zM2IpfZV654DFybMhMLimy0cuUNsnU5L8O2byu9eHmhdWcIvsb1t8AWi-tKNkXFq7Neo/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A mobile app screenshot with generated annotations that include UI elements and their descriptions, e.g., <code>TEXT</code> elements also contain the text content from OCR, <code>IMAGE</code> elements contain image captions, <code>LIST_ITEMs</code> contain all their child elements.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br />\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>LLM-based data generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWe enhance the pre-training data's diversity using <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/\">PaLM 2</a> to generate input-output pairs in a two-step process.

However, we also note that our approach still lags behind large models and further research is needed to bridge this gap.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n<em>This project is the result of joint work with Maria Wang, Fedir Zubach, Hassan Mansoor, Vincent Etter, Victor Carbune, Jason Lin, Jindong Chen and Abhanshu Sharma.

      "summary": "Google researchers developed an algorithm to reconstruct 3D objects from multiple images and infer unknown camera poses.",
      "summary_original": "Posted by Mark Matthews, Senior Software Engineer, and Dmitry Lagun, Research Scientist, Google Research A person's prior experience and understanding of the world generally enables them to easily infer what an object looks like in whole, even if only looking at a few 2D pictures of it. Yet the capacity for a computer to reconstruct the shape of an object in 3D given only a few images has remained a difficult algorithmic problem for years. This fundamental computer vision task has applications ranging from the creation of e-commerce 3D models to autonomous vehicle navigation. A key part of the problem is how to determine the exact positions from which images were taken, known as pose inference. If camera poses are known, a range of successful techniques \u2014 such as neural radiance fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting \u2014 can reconstruct an object in 3D. But if these poses are not available, then we face a difficult \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem where we could determine the poses if we knew the 3D object, but we can\u2019t reconstruct the 3D object until we know the camera poses. The problem is made harder by pseudo-symmetries \u2014 i.e., many objects look similar when viewed from different angles. For example, square objects like a chair tend to look similar every 90\u00b0 rotation. Pseudo-symmetries of an object can be revealed by rendering it on a turntable from various angles and plotting its photometric self-similarity map. Self-Similarity map of a toy truck model. Left: The model is rendered on a turntable from various azimuthal angles, \u03b8. Right: The average L2 RGB similarity of a rendering from \u03b8 with that of \u03b8*. The pseudo-similarities are indicated by the dashed red lines. The diagram above only visualizes one dimension of rotation. It becomes even more complex (and difficult to visualize) when introducing more degrees of freedom. Pseudo-symmetries make the problem ill-posed, with na\u00efve approaches often converging to local minima. In practice, such an approach might mistake the back view as the front view of an object, because they share a similar silhouette. Previous techniques (such as BARF or SAMURAI) side-step this problem by relying on an initial pose estimate that starts close to the global minima. But how can we approach this if those aren\u2019t available? Methods, such as GNeRF and VMRF leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to overcome the problem. These techniques have the ability to artificially \u201camplify\u201d a limited number of training views, aiding reconstruction. GAN techniques, however, often have complex, sometimes unstable, training processes, making robust and reliable convergence difficult to achieve in practice. A range of other successful methods, such as SparsePose or RUST, can infer poses from a limited number views, but require pre-training on a large dataset of posed images, which aren\u2019t always available, and can suffer from \u201cdomain-gap\u201d issues when inferring poses for different types of images. In \u201cMELON: NeRF with Unposed Images in SO(3)\u201d, spotlighted at 3DV 2024, we present a technique that can determine object-centric camera poses entirely from scratch while reconstructing the object in 3D. MELON (Modulo Equivalent Latent Optimization of NeRF) is one of the first techniques that can do this without initial pose camera estimates, complex training schemes or pre-training on labeled data. MELON is a relatively simple technique that can easily be integrated into existing NeRF methods. We demonstrate that MELON can reconstruct a NeRF from unposed images with state-of-the-art accuracy while requiring as few as 4\u20136 images of an object. MELON We leverage two key techniques to aid convergence of this ill-posed problem. The first is a very lightweight, dynamically trained convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder that regresses camera poses from training images. We pass a downscaled training image to a four layer CNN that infers the camera pose. This CNN is initialized from noise and requires no pre-training. Its capacity is so small that it forces similar looking images to similar poses, providing an implicit regularization greatly aiding convergence. The second technique is a modulo loss that simultaneously considers pseudo symmetries of an object. We render the object from a fixed set of viewpoints for each training image, backpropagating the loss only through the view that best fits the training image. This effectively considers the plausibility of multiple views for each image. In practice, we find N=2 views (viewing an object from the other side) is all that\u2019s required in most cases, but sometimes get better results with N=4 for square objects. These two techniques are integrated into standard NeRF training, except that instead of fixed camera poses, poses are inferred by the CNN and duplicated by the modulo loss. Photometric gradients back-propagate through the best-fitting cameras into the CNN. We observe that cameras generally converge quickly to globally optimal poses (see animation below). After training of the neural field, MELON can synthesize novel views using standard NeRF rendering methods. We simplify the problem by using the NeRF-Synthetic dataset, a popular benchmark for NeRF research and common in the pose-inference literature. This synthetic dataset has cameras at precisely fixed distances and a consistent \u201cup\u201d orientation, requiring us to infer only the polar coordinates of the camera. This is the same as an object at the center of a globe with a camera always pointing at it, moving along the surface. We then only need the latitude and longitude (2 degrees of freedom) to specify the camera pose. MELON uses a dynamically trained lightweight CNN encoder that predicts a pose for each image. Predicted poses are replicated by the modulo loss, which only penalizes the smallest L2 distance from the ground truth color. At evaluation time, the neural field can be used to generate novel views. Results We compute two key metrics to evaluate MELON\u2019s performance on the NeRF Synthetic dataset. The error in orientation between the ground truth and inferred poses can be quantified as a single angular error that we average across all training images, the pose error. We then test the accuracy of MELON\u2019s rendered objects from novel views by measuring the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) against held out test views. We see that MELON quickly converges to the approximate poses of most cameras within the first 1,000 steps of training, and achieves a competitive PSNR of 27.5 dB after 50k steps. Convergence of MELON on a toy truck model during optimization. Left: Rendering of the NeRF. Right: Polar plot of predicted (blue x), and ground truth (red dot) cameras. MELON achieves similar results for other scenes in the NeRF Synthetic dataset. Reconstruction quality comparison between ground-truth (GT) and MELON on NeRF-Synthetic scenes after 100k training steps. Noisy images MELON also works well when performing novel view synthesis from extremely noisy, unposed images. We add varying amounts, \u03c3, of white Gaussian noise to the training images. For example, the object in \u03c3=1.0 below is impossible to make out, yet MELON can determine the pose and generate novel views of the object. Novel view synthesis from noisy unposed 128\u00d7128 images. Top: Example of noise level present in training views. Bottom: Reconstructed model from noisy training views and mean angular pose error. This perhaps shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, given that techniques like RawNeRF have demonstrated NeRF\u2019s excellent de-noising capabilities with known camera poses. The fact that MELON works for noisy images of unknown camera poses so robustly was unexpected. Conclusion We present MELON, a technique that can determine object-centric camera poses to reconstruct objects in 3D without the need for approximate pose initializations, complex GAN training schemes or pre-training on labeled data. MELON is a relatively simple technique that can easily be integrated into existing NeRF methods. Though we only demonstrated MELON on synthetic images we are adapting our technique to work in real world conditions. See the paper and MELON site to learn more.

These techniques have the ability to artificially \u201camplify\u201d a limited number of training views, aiding reconstruction. GAN techniques, however, often have complex, sometimes unstable, training processes, making robust and reliable convergence difficult to achieve in practice.

MELON is a relatively simple technique that can easily be integrated into existing NeRF methods. We demonstrate that MELON can reconstruct a NeRF from unposed images with state-of-the-art accuracy while requiring as few as 4\u20136 images of an object. \n</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>MELON</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe leverage two key techniques to aid convergence of this ill-posed problem. The first is a very lightweight, dynamically trained <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network\">convolutional neural network</a> (CNN) encoder that regresses camera poses from training images. We pass a downscaled training image to a four layer CNN that infers the camera pose. This CNN is initialized from noise and requires no pre-training. Its capacity is so small that it forces similar looking images to similar poses, providing an implicit regularization greatly aiding convergence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe second technique is a <em>modulo loss</em> that simultaneously considers pseudo symmetries of an object. We render the object from a fixed set of viewpoints for each training image, backpropagating the loss only through the view that best fits the training image. This effectively considers the plausibility of multiple views for each image. In practice, we find <em>N</em>=2 views (viewing an object from the other side) is all that\u2019s required in most cases, but sometimes get better results with <em>N</em>=4 for square objects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese two techniques are integrated into standard NeRF training, except that instead of fixed camera poses, poses are inferred by the CNN and duplicated by the modulo loss. Photometric gradients back-propagate through the best-fitting cameras into the CNN. We observe that cameras generally converge quickly to globally optimal poses (see animation below). After training of the neural field, MELON can synthesize novel views using standard NeRF rendering methods.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe simplify the problem by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/bmild/nerf\">NeRF-Synthetic</a> dataset, a popular benchmark for NeRF research and common in the pose-inference literature. This synthetic dataset has cameras at precisely fixed distances and a consistent \u201cup\u201d orientation, requiring us to infer only the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system\">polar coordinates</a> of the camera. This is the same as an object at the center of a globe with a camera always pointing at it, moving along the surface. We then only need the latitude and longitude (2 degrees of freedom) to specify the camera pose.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEjisRopoeGPgbCRa3sQ7hmBUtnfI6TRapBD7Yn96xeDA_LxzTayiw3DMijPHS0ovkLVTcQGpp2_gAyA_P5BCPwXuEcz7lApC8WQbGfMvj_aAxShjgsmcklf_-4ekgbFH6VZ92Ey3Ta4XAhZvEdc00D2o7SzPIOSnFAj8CgrdmdJunijsGaw1Zx46b94wk/s1315/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEjisRopoeGPgbCRa3sQ7hmBUtnfI6TRapBD7Yn96xeDA_LxzTayiw3DMijPHS0ovkLVTcQGpp2_gAyA_P5BCPwXuEcz7lApC8WQbGfMvj_aAxShjgsmcklf_-4ekgbFH6VZ92Ey3Ta4XAhZvEdc00D2o7SzPIOSnFAj8CgrdmdJunijsGaw1Zx46b94wk/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">MELON uses a dynamically trained lightweight CNN encoder that predicts a pose for each image.

The error in orientation between the ground truth and inferred poses can be quantified as a single angular error that we average across all training images, the pose error. We then test the accuracy of MELON\u2019s rendered objects from novel views by measuring the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio\">peak signal-to-noise ratio</a> (PSNR) against held out test views. We see that MELON quickly converges to the approximate poses of most cameras within the first 1,000 steps of training, and achieves a competitive PSNR of 27.5 dB after 50k steps. \n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU5wdw89PfwRbvZeaIWLM3rNEAo69__A-ovDwB5x8emIkAGZq05FgF-wDMNlkXPS6tOcC_0NJVD4Glq8eX02yb3CDIiqXbadI4lnvcZ_MI9sHUkz8risxP1orPA8ZnTZUq-PcRLPoEc_AmFuARCokXHQlTOv_q35TH1tivuK2PpA54hO7q7kh_M8ZynO-J/s960/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU5wdw89PfwRbvZeaIWLM3rNEAo69__A-ovDwB5x8emIkAGZq05FgF-wDMNlkXPS6tOcC_0NJVD4Glq8eX02yb3CDIiqXbadI4lnvcZ_MI9sHUkz8risxP1orPA8ZnTZUq-PcRLPoEc_AmFuARCokXHQlTOv_q35TH1tivuK2PpA54hO7q7kh_M8ZynO-J/s16000/image1.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Convergence of MELON on a toy truck model during optimization. <strong>Left</strong>: Rendering of the NeRF. <strong>Right</strong>: Polar plot of predicted (blue <em>x</em>), and ground truth (red dot) cameras.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nMELON achieves similar results for other scenes in the NeRF Synthetic dataset.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWEC7CE_iWu1QZ_jgEUHHCEdqaUBMO7cK-1DZuHaZRDq4Y59_CriUlb_aOSJP5psB6Cbs1E41mm81EsfwVM0zAUojRKToWwiDmPfaWFPr2UGqf6F4n3P8ZpgYxiqyWIgst6op3Fhsbu0nlR727zLVV38KqJvNFY_KDeoJbdOjJFpHjLZkEd95Z9TqSg4R_/s1999/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWEC7CE_iWu1QZ_jgEUHHCEdqaUBMO7cK-1DZuHaZRDq4Y59_CriUlb_aOSJP5psB6Cbs1E41mm81EsfwVM0zAUojRKToWwiDmPfaWFPr2UGqf6F4n3P8ZpgYxiqyWIgst6op3Fhsbu0nlR727zLVV38KqJvNFY_KDeoJbdOjJFpHjLZkEd95Z9TqSg4R_/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Reconstruction quality comparison between ground-truth (GT) and MELON on NeRF-Synthetic scenes after 100k training steps.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Noisy images</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nMELON also works well when performing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_synthesis\">novel view synthesis</a> from extremely noisy, unposed images.

Photometric gradients back-propagate through the best-fitting cameras into the CNN. We observe that cameras generally converge quickly to globally optimal poses (see animation below). After training of the neural field, MELON can synthesize novel views using standard NeRF rendering methods.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe simplify the problem by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/bmild/nerf\">NeRF-Synthetic</a> dataset, a popular benchmark for NeRF research and common in the pose-inference literature. This synthetic dataset has cameras at precisely fixed distances and a consistent \u201cup\u201d orientation, requiring us to infer only the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system\">polar coordinates</a> of the camera. This is the same as an object at the center of a globe with a camera always pointing at it, moving along the surface. We then only need the latitude and longitude (2 degrees of freedom) to specify the camera pose.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEjisRopoeGPgbCRa3sQ7hmBUtnfI6TRapBD7Yn96xeDA_LxzTayiw3DMijPHS0ovkLVTcQGpp2_gAyA_P5BCPwXuEcz7lApC8WQbGfMvj_aAxShjgsmcklf_-4ekgbFH6VZ92Ey3Ta4XAhZvEdc00D2o7SzPIOSnFAj8CgrdmdJunijsGaw1Zx46b94wk/s1315/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEjisRopoeGPgbCRa3sQ7hmBUtnfI6TRapBD7Yn96xeDA_LxzTayiw3DMijPHS0ovkLVTcQGpp2_gAyA_P5BCPwXuEcz7lApC8WQbGfMvj_aAxShjgsmcklf_-4ekgbFH6VZ92Ey3Ta4XAhZvEdc00D2o7SzPIOSnFAj8CgrdmdJunijsGaw1Zx46b94wk/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">MELON uses a dynamically trained lightweight CNN encoder that predicts a pose for each image.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Mike Schaekermann, Research Scientist, Google Research, and Ivor Horn, Chief Health Equity Officer & Director, Google Core Health equity is a major societal concern worldwide with disparities having many causes. These sources include limitations in access to healthcare, differences in clinical treatment, and even fundamental differences in the diagnostic technology. In dermatology for example, skin cancer outcomes are worse for populations such as minorities, those with lower socioeconomic status, or individuals with limited healthcare access. While there is great promise in recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve healthcare, this transition from research to bedside must be accompanied by a careful understanding of whether and how they impact health equity. Health equity is defined by public health organizations as fairness of opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as possible. Importantly, equity may be different from equality. For example, people with greater barriers to improving their health may require more or different effort to experience this fair opportunity. Similarly, equity is not fairness as defined in the AI for healthcare literature. Whereas AI fairness often strives for equal performance of the AI technology across different patient populations, this does not center the goal of prioritizing performance with respect to pre-existing health disparities. Health equity considerations. An intervention (e.g., an ML-based tool, indicated in dark blue) promotes health equity if it helps reduce existing disparities in health outcomes (indicated in lighter blue). In \u201cHealth Equity Assessment of machine Learning performance (HEAL): a framework and dermatology AI model case study\u201d, published in The Lancet eClinicalMedicine, we propose a methodology to quantitatively assess whether ML-based health technologies perform equitably. In other words, does the ML model perform well for those with the worst health outcomes for the condition(s) the model is meant to address? This goal anchors on the principle that health equity should prioritize and measure model performance with respect to disparate health outcomes, which may be due to a number of factors that include structural inequities (e.g., demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, environmental and geographic). The health equity framework (HEAL) The HEAL framework proposes a 4-step process to estimate the likelihood that an ML-based health technology performs equitably: Identify factors associated with health inequities and define tool performance metrics, Identify and quantify pre-existing health disparities, Measure the performance of the tool for each subpopulation, Measure the likelihood that the tool prioritizes performance with respect to health disparities. The final step\u2019s output is termed the HEAL metric, which quantifies how anticorrelated the ML model\u2019s performance is with health disparities. In other words, does the model perform better with populations that have the worse health outcomes? This 4-step process is designed to inform improvements for making ML model performance more equitable, and is meant to be iterative and re-evaluated on a regular basis. For example, the availability of health outcomes data in step (2) can inform the choice of demographic factors and brackets in step (1), and the framework can be applied again with new datasets, models and populations. Framework for Health Equity Assessment of machine Learning performance (HEAL). Our guiding principle is to avoid exacerbating health inequities, and these steps help us identify disparities and assess for inequitable model performance to move towards better outcomes for all. With this work, we take a step towards encouraging explicit assessment of the health equity considerations of AI technologies, and encourage prioritization of efforts during model development to reduce health inequities for subpopulations exposed to structural inequities that can precipitate disparate outcomes. We should note that the present framework does not model causal relationships and, therefore, cannot quantify the actual impact a new technology will have on reducing health outcome disparities. However, the HEAL metric may help identify opportunities for improvement, where the current performance is not prioritized with respect to pre-existing health disparities. Case study on a dermatology model As an illustrative case study, we applied the framework to a dermatology model, which utilizes a convolutional neural network similar to that described in prior work. This example dermatology model was trained to classify 288 skin conditions using a development dataset of 29k cases. The input to the model consists of three photos of a skin concern along with demographic information and a brief structured medical history. The output consists of a ranked list of possible matching skin conditions. Using the HEAL framework, we evaluated this model by assessing whether it prioritized performance with respect to pre-existing health outcomes. The model was designed to predict possible dermatologic conditions (from a list of hundreds) based on photos of a skin concern and patient metadata. Evaluation of the model is done using a top-3 agreement metric, which quantifies how often the top 3 output conditions match the most likely condition as suggested by a dermatologist panel. The HEAL metric is computed via the anticorrelation of this top-3 agreement with health outcome rankings. We used a dataset of 5,420 teledermatology cases, enriched for diversity in age, sex and race/ethnicity, to retrospectively evaluate the model\u2019s HEAL metric. The dataset consisted of \u201cstore-and-forward\u201d cases from patients of 20 years or older from primary care providers in the USA and skin cancer clinics in Australia. Based on a review of the literature, we decided to explore race/ethnicity, sex and age as potential factors of inequity, and used sampling techniques to ensure that our evaluation dataset had sufficient representation of all race/ethnicity, sex and age groups. To quantify pre-existing health outcomes for each subgroup we relied on measurements from public databases endorsed by the World Health Organization, such as Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs; years of life lost plus years lived with disability). HEAL metric for all dermatologic conditions across race/ethnicity subpopulations, including health outcomes (YLLs per 100,000), model performance (top-3 agreement), and rankings for health outcomes and tool performance.(* Higher is better; measures the likelihood the model performs equitably with respect to the axes in this table.) HEAL metric for all dermatologic conditions across sexes, including health outcomes (DALYs per 100,000), model performance (top-3 agreement), and rankings for health outcomes and tool performance. (* As above.) Our analysis estimated that the model was 80.5% likely to perform equitably across race/ethnicity subgroups and 92.1% likely to perform equitably across sexes. However, while the model was likely to perform equitably across age groups for cancer conditions specifically, we discovered that it had room for improvement across age groups for non-cancer conditions. For example, those 70+ have the poorest health outcomes related to non-cancer skin conditions, yet the model didn't prioritize performance for this subgroup. HEAL metrics for all cancer and non-cancer dermatologic conditions across age groups, including health outcomes (DALYs per 100,000), model performance (top-3 agreement), and rankings for health outcomes and tool performance. (* As above.) Putting things in context For holistic evaluation, the HEAL metric cannot be employed in isolation. Instead this metric should be contextualized alongside many other factors ranging from computational efficiency and data privacy to ethical values, and aspects that may influence the results (e.g., selection bias or differences in representativeness of the evaluation data across demographic groups). As an adversarial example, the HEAL metric can be artificially improved by deliberately reducing model performance for the most advantaged subpopulation until performance for that subpopulation is worse than all others. For illustrative purposes, given subpopulations A and B where A has worse health outcomes than B, consider the choice between two models: Model 1 (M1) performs 5% better for subpopulation A than for subpopulation B. Model 2 (M2) performs 5% worse on subpopulation A than B. The HEAL metric would be higher for M1 because it prioritizes performance on a subpopulation with worse outcomes. However, M1 may have absolute performances of just 75% and 70% for subpopulations A and B respectively, while M2 has absolute performances of 75% and 80% for subpopulations A and B respectively. Choosing M1 over M2 would lead to worse overall performance for all subpopulations because some subpopulations are worse-off while no subpopulation is better-off. Accordingly, the HEAL metric should be used alongside a Pareto condition (discussed further in the paper), which restricts model changes so that outcomes for each subpopulation are either unchanged or improved compared to the status quo, and performance does not worsen for any subpopulation. The HEAL framework, in its current form, assesses the likelihood that an ML-based model prioritizes performance for subpopulations with respect to pre-existing health disparities for specific subpopulations. This differs from the goal of understanding whether ML will reduce disparities in outcomes across subpopulations in reality. Specifically, modeling improvements in outcomes requires a causal understanding of steps in the care journey that happen both before and after use of any given model. Future research is needed to address this gap. Conclusion The HEAL framework enables a quantitative assessment of the likelihood that health AI technologies prioritize performance with respect to health disparities. The case study demonstrates how to apply the framework in the dermatological domain, indicating a high likelihood that model performance is prioritized with respect to health disparities across sex and race/ethnicity, but also revealing the potential for improvements for non-cancer conditions across age. The case study also illustrates limitations in the ability to apply all recommended aspects of the framework (e.g., mapping societal context, availability of data), thus highlighting the complexity of health equity considerations of ML-based tools. This work is a proposed approach to address a grand challenge for AI and health equity, and may provide a useful evaluation framework not only during model development, but during pre-implementation and real-world monitoring stages, e.g., in the form of health equity dashboards. We hold that the strength of the HEAL framework is in its future application to various AI tools and use cases and its refinement in the process. Finally, we acknowledge that a successful approach towards understanding the impact of AI technologies on health equity needs to be more than a set of metrics. It will require a set of goals agreed upon by a community that represents those who will be most impacted by a model.

Instead this metric should be contextualized alongside many other factors ranging from computational efficiency and data privacy to ethical values, and aspects that may influence the results (e.g., selection bias or differences in representativeness of the evaluation data across demographic groups). \n</p>\n<p>\nAs an adversarial example, the HEAL metric can be artificially improved by deliberately reducing model performance for the most advantaged subpopulation until performance for that subpopulation is worse than all others. For illustrative purposes, given subpopulations A and B where A has worse health outcomes than B, consider the choice between two models: Model 1 (M1) performs 5% better for subpopulation A than for subpopulation B. Model 2 (M2) performs 5% worse on subpopulation A than B. The HEAL metric would be higher for M1 because it prioritizes performance on a subpopulation with worse outcomes. However, M1 may have absolute performances of just 75% and 70% for subpopulations A and B respectively, while M2 has absolute performances of 75% and 80% for subpopulations A and B respectively. Choosing M1 over M2 would lead to worse overall performance for all subpopulations because some subpopulations are worse-off while no subpopulation is better-off. \n</p>\n<p>\nAccordingly, the HEAL metric should be used alongside a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\">Pareto condition</a> (discussed further in the paper), which restricts model changes so that outcomes for each subpopulation are either unchanged or improved compared to the status quo, and performance does not worsen for any subpopulation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework, in its current form, assesses the likelihood that an ML-based model prioritizes performance for subpopulations with respect to pre-existing health disparities for specific subpopulations. This differs from the goal of understanding whether ML will reduce disparities in outcomes across subpopulations in reality. Specifically, modeling improvements in outcomes requires a causal understanding of steps in the care journey that happen both before and after use of any given model. Future research is needed to address this gap.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework enables a quantitative assessment of the likelihood that health AI technologies prioritize performance with respect to health disparities. The case study demonstrates how to apply the framework in the dermatological domain, indicating a high likelihood that model performance is prioritized with respect to health disparities across sex and race/ethnicity, but also revealing the potential for improvements for non-cancer conditions across age. The case study also illustrates limitations in the ability to apply all recommended aspects of the framework (e.g., mapping societal context, availability of data), thus highlighting the complexity of health equity considerations of ML-based tools. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis work is a proposed approach to address a grand challenge for AI and health equity, and may provide a useful evaluation framework not only during model development, but during pre-implementation and real-world monitoring stages, e.g., in the form of health equity dashboards. We hold that the strength of the HEAL framework is in its future application to various AI tools and use cases and its refinement in the process. Finally, we acknowledge that a successful approach towards understanding the impact of AI technologies on health equity needs to be more than a set of metrics. It will require a set of goals agreed upon by a community that represents those who will be most impacted by a model.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n<em>The research described here is joint work across many teams at Google.

These sources include limitations in access to healthcare, differences in clinical treatment, and even fundamental differences in the diagnostic technology. In dermatology for example, skin cancer outcomes are worse for populations such as minorities, those with lower socioeconomic status, or individuals with limited healthcare access. While there is great promise in recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve healthcare, this transition from research to bedside must be accompanied by a careful understanding of whether and how they impact health equity.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a> \n\n<p>\n<em>Health equity</em> is defined by public health organizations as fairness of opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as possible. Importantly, equity may be different from <em>equality</em>. For example, people with greater barriers to improving their health may require more or different effort to experience this fair opportunity. Similarly, equity is not <em>fairness</em> as defined in the AI for healthcare literature. Whereas AI fairness often strives for equal performance of the AI technology across different patient populations, this does not center the goal of prioritizing performance with respect to pre-existing health disparities.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi21VRS33NG-Imj1XlKXWtrwUrl4loEEywV0tO8M0JWtUFFksbTLOhilTZtMdJTgOBdXACUPQX-f5TMAFkABFhdv_cEDmFn4d-JirU78covJI32sHus6XQVJ1C1elwM_MExsQfeVCpFYlq9QZeynLNpLqmW8GqM-DKWiGSyi_18n8Xb3-8IeepHSyBZ6_2l/s1999/image2.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi21VRS33NG-Imj1XlKXWtrwUrl4loEEywV0tO8M0JWtUFFksbTLOhilTZtMdJTgOBdXACUPQX-f5TMAFkABFhdv_cEDmFn4d-JirU78covJI32sHus6XQVJ1C1elwM_MExsQfeVCpFYlq9QZeynLNpLqmW8GqM-DKWiGSyi_18n8Xb3-8IeepHSyBZ6_2l/s16000/image2.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Health equity considerations.

In other words, does the ML model perform well for those with the worst health outcomes for the condition(s) the model is meant to address? This goal anchors on the principle that health equity should prioritize and measure model performance with respect to disparate health outcomes, which may be due to a number of factors that include structural inequities (e.g., demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, environmental and geographic).\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>The health equity framework (HEAL)</h2>\n\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework proposes a 4-step process to estimate the likelihood that an ML-based health technology performs equitably:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nIdentify factors associated with health inequities and define tool performance metrics,\n</li>\n<li>\nIdentify and quantify pre-existing health disparities,\n</li>\n<li>\nMeasure the performance of the tool for each subpopulation,\n</li>\n<li>\nMeasure the likelihood that the tool prioritizes performance with respect to health disparities.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nThe final step\u2019s output is termed the HEAL metric, which quantifies how anticorrelated the ML model\u2019s performance is with health disparities. In other words, does the model perform better with populations that have the worse health outcomes?\n</p>\n<p>\nThis 4-step process is designed to inform improvements for making ML model performance more equitable, and is meant to be iterative and re-evaluated on a regular basis. For example, the availability of health outcomes data in step (2) can inform the choice of demographic factors and brackets in step (1), and the framework can be applied again with new datasets, models and populations.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoGLCxn9QWS5QQpW39mJH1A_pw9wniWKIGGapN_gBC5WdxAWo4jHRS29GhNq7XBgNdZ867tMdP7TcszMz2WxUR4sYBFz0-dJ4cQZCODN2YFRjCP14QhNh_kMVGUdklbToOCYwHXV-UofhZdwZzDZudaVedOqvcC-QbW3LtMGb04FwFclbfzKHVUcqHodW_/s1999/image1.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoGLCxn9QWS5QQpW39mJH1A_pw9wniWKIGGapN_gBC5WdxAWo4jHRS29GhNq7XBgNdZ867tMdP7TcszMz2WxUR4sYBFz0-dJ4cQZCODN2YFRjCP14QhNh_kMVGUdklbToOCYwHXV-UofhZdwZzDZudaVedOqvcC-QbW3LtMGb04FwFclbfzKHVUcqHodW_/s16000/image1.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Framework for Health Equity Assessment of machine Learning performance (HEAL).&nbsp;Our guiding principle is to avoid exacerbating health inequities, and these steps help us identify disparities and assess for inequitable model performance to move towards better outcomes for all.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>\nWith this work, we take a step towards encouraging explicit assessment of the health equity considerations of AI technologies, and encourage prioritization of efforts during model development to reduce health inequities for subpopulations exposed to structural inequities that can precipitate disparate outcomes.

In other words, does the ML model perform well for those with the worst health outcomes for the condition(s) the model is meant to address? This goal anchors on the principle that health equity should prioritize and measure model performance with respect to disparate health outcomes, which may be due to a number of factors that include structural inequities (e.g., demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, environmental and geographic).\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>The health equity framework (HEAL)</h2>\n\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework proposes a 4-step process to estimate the likelihood that an ML-based health technology performs equitably:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nIdentify factors associated with health inequities and define tool performance metrics,\n</li>\n<li>\nIdentify and quantify pre-existing health disparities,\n</li>\n<li>\nMeasure the performance of the tool for each subpopulation,\n</li>\n<li>\nMeasure the likelihood that the tool prioritizes performance with respect to health disparities.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nThe final step\u2019s output is termed the HEAL metric, which quantifies how anticorrelated the ML model\u2019s performance is with health disparities. In other words, does the model perform better with populations that have the worse health outcomes?\n</p>\n<p>\nThis 4-step process is designed to inform improvements for making ML model performance more equitable, and is meant to be iterative and re-evaluated on a regular basis. For example, the availability of health outcomes data in step (2) can inform the choice of demographic factors and brackets in step (1), and the framework can be applied again with new datasets, models and populations.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoGLCxn9QWS5QQpW39mJH1A_pw9wniWKIGGapN_gBC5WdxAWo4jHRS29GhNq7XBgNdZ867tMdP7TcszMz2WxUR4sYBFz0-dJ4cQZCODN2YFRjCP14QhNh_kMVGUdklbToOCYwHXV-UofhZdwZzDZudaVedOqvcC-QbW3LtMGb04FwFclbfzKHVUcqHodW_/s1999/image1.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoGLCxn9QWS5QQpW39mJH1A_pw9wniWKIGGapN_gBC5WdxAWo4jHRS29GhNq7XBgNdZ867tMdP7TcszMz2WxUR4sYBFz0-dJ4cQZCODN2YFRjCP14QhNh_kMVGUdklbToOCYwHXV-UofhZdwZzDZudaVedOqvcC-QbW3LtMGb04FwFclbfzKHVUcqHodW_/s16000/image1.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Framework for Health Equity Assessment of machine Learning performance (HEAL).&nbsp;Our guiding principle is to avoid exacerbating health inequities, and these steps help us identify disparities and assess for inequitable model performance to move towards better outcomes for all.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>\nWith this work, we take a step towards encouraging explicit assessment of the health equity considerations of AI technologies, and encourage prioritization of efforts during model development to reduce health inequities for subpopulations exposed to structural inequities that can precipitate disparate outcomes. We should note that the present framework does not model causal relationships and, therefore, cannot quantify the actual impact a new technology will have on reducing health outcome disparities. However, the HEAL metric may help identify opportunities for improvement, where the current performance is not prioritized with respect to pre-existing health disparities.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Case study on a dermatology model</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nAs an illustrative case study, we applied the framework to a dermatology model, which utilizes a convolutional neural network similar to that described in <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2019/09/using-deep-learning-to-inform.html\">prior work</a>. This example dermatology model was trained to classify 288 skin conditions using a development dataset of 29k cases. The input to the model consists of three photos of a skin concern along with demographic information and a brief structured medical history. The output consists of a ranked list of possible matching skin conditions. \n</p>\n<p>\nUsing the HEAL framework, we evaluated this model by assessing whether it prioritized performance with respect to pre-existing health outcomes. The model was designed to predict possible dermatologic conditions (from a list of hundreds) based on photos of a skin concern and patient metadata. Evaluation of the model is done using a top-3 agreement metric, which quantifies how often the top 3 output conditions match the most likely condition as suggested by a dermatologist panel. The HEAL metric is computed via the anticorrelation of this top-3 agreement with health outcome rankings. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe used a dataset of 5,420 teledermatology cases, enriched for diversity in age, sex and race/ethnicity, to retrospectively evaluate the model\u2019s HEAL metric. The dataset consisted of \u201cstore-and-forward\u201d cases from patients of 20 years or older from primary care providers in the USA and skin cancer clinics in Australia. Based on a review of the literature, we decided to explore race/ethnicity, sex and age as potential factors of inequity, and used sampling techniques to ensure that our evaluation dataset had sufficient representation of all race/ethnicity, sex and age groups. To quantify pre-existing health outcomes for each subgroup we relied on measurements from <a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/global-health-estimates-leading-causes-of-dalys\">public</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext\">databases</a> endorsed by the World Health Organization, such as <a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/4427\">Years of Life Lost</a> (YLLs) and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158\">Disability-Adjusted Life Years</a> (DALYs; years of life lost plus years lived with disability).\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSS4J8AzS5iaHYvB7RyUVEDkx1ykrC7zOEAbUvjb8ZybZRZ0C71fRlJjPYBzGYVu9D3Ok0zRdz4MUdHMX6rOqnYKoHv91QNPw0TiqHJ6MKjtgn_UIqW-xoZeihO-A-ZrPgWT8bs-t9bSZWmMQ9AJaQh85BZWHH-T0KPWMx2unNO9HpTzYXiD_24gwNYWot/s1511/Table1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSS4J8AzS5iaHYvB7RyUVEDkx1ykrC7zOEAbUvjb8ZybZRZ0C71fRlJjPYBzGYVu9D3Ok0zRdz4MUdHMX6rOqnYKoHv91QNPw0TiqHJ6MKjtgn_UIqW-xoZeihO-A-ZrPgWT8bs-t9bSZWmMQ9AJaQh85BZWHH-T0KPWMx2unNO9HpTzYXiD_24gwNYWot/s16000/Table1.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">HEAL metric for all dermatologic conditions across race/ethnicity subpopulations, including health outcomes (YLLs per 100,000), model performance (top-3 agreement), and rankings for health outcomes and tool performance.<br />(* Higher is better; measures the likelihood the model performs equitably with respect to the axes in this table.)</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMAQjyuGMXvzq4FxZg5Vhlgozwwnzza-QS-mjr3i0oOnDFIeqUGTrPxX2c7ssbpCZtLUoT2lpr8bXg_nJ3ToaaVe6Grge-HcWQl8SFy1gaBCoT-6ZHtFmQV4_S2sA6eOsdMFryegLjZFwOcPiqZDfFFItxqS96ysTZZn1OXVcbQSOG5WazZGjxSkNt9JQK/s1518/Table2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMAQjyuGMXvzq4FxZg5Vhlgozwwnzza-QS-mjr3i0oOnDFIeqUGTrPxX2c7ssbpCZtLUoT2lpr8bXg_nJ3ToaaVe6Grge-HcWQl8SFy1gaBCoT-6ZHtFmQV4_S2sA6eOsdMFryegLjZFwOcPiqZDfFFItxqS96ysTZZn1OXVcbQSOG5WazZGjxSkNt9JQK/s16000/Table2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">HEAL metric for all dermatologic conditions across sexes, including health outcomes (DALYs per 100,000), model performance (top-3 agreement), and rankings for health outcomes and tool performance.

(* As above.)</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Putting things in context</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nFor holistic evaluation, the HEAL metric cannot be employed in isolation. Instead this metric should be contextualized alongside many other factors ranging from computational efficiency and data privacy to ethical values, and aspects that may influence the results (e.g., selection bias or differences in representativeness of the evaluation data across demographic groups). \n</p>\n<p>\nAs an adversarial example, the HEAL metric can be artificially improved by deliberately reducing model performance for the most advantaged subpopulation until performance for that subpopulation is worse than all others. For illustrative purposes, given subpopulations A and B where A has worse health outcomes than B, consider the choice between two models: Model 1 (M1) performs 5% better for subpopulation A than for subpopulation B. Model 2 (M2) performs 5% worse on subpopulation A than B. The HEAL metric would be higher for M1 because it prioritizes performance on a subpopulation with worse outcomes. However, M1 may have absolute performances of just 75% and 70% for subpopulations A and B respectively, while M2 has absolute performances of 75% and 80% for subpopulations A and B respectively. Choosing M1 over M2 would lead to worse overall performance for all subpopulations because some subpopulations are worse-off while no subpopulation is better-off. \n</p>\n<p>\nAccordingly, the HEAL metric should be used alongside a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\">Pareto condition</a> (discussed further in the paper), which restricts model changes so that outcomes for each subpopulation are either unchanged or improved compared to the status quo, and performance does not worsen for any subpopulation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework, in its current form, assesses the likelihood that an ML-based model prioritizes performance for subpopulations with respect to pre-existing health disparities for specific subpopulations. This differs from the goal of understanding whether ML will reduce disparities in outcomes across subpopulations in reality. Specifically, modeling improvements in outcomes requires a causal understanding of steps in the care journey that happen both before and after use of any given model. Future research is needed to address this gap.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework enables a quantitative assessment of the likelihood that health AI technologies prioritize performance with respect to health disparities. The case study demonstrates how to apply the framework in the dermatological domain, indicating a high likelihood that model performance is prioritized with respect to health disparities across sex and race/ethnicity, but also revealing the potential for improvements for non-cancer conditions across age. The case study also illustrates limitations in the ability to apply all recommended aspects of the framework (e.g., mapping societal context, availability of data), thus highlighting the complexity of health equity considerations of ML-based tools. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis work is a proposed approach to address a grand challenge for AI and health equity, and may provide a useful evaluation framework not only during model development, but during pre-implementation and real-world monitoring stages, e.g., in the form of health equity dashboards. We hold that the strength of the HEAL framework is in its future application to various AI tools and use cases and its refinement in the process. Finally, we acknowledge that a successful approach towards understanding the impact of AI technologies on health equity needs to be more than a set of metrics. It will require a set of goals agreed upon by a community that represents those who will be most impacted by a model.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n<em>The research described here is joint work across many teams at Google.

These sources include limitations in access to healthcare, differences in clinical treatment, and even fundamental differences in the diagnostic technology. In dermatology for example, skin cancer outcomes are worse for populations such as minorities, those with lower socioeconomic status, or individuals with limited healthcare access. While there is great promise in recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve healthcare, this transition from research to bedside must be accompanied by a careful understanding of whether and how they impact health equity.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a> \n\n<p>\n<em>Health equity</em> is defined by public health organizations as fairness of opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as possible.

Similarly, equity is not <em>fairness</em> as defined in the AI for healthcare literature.

Instead this metric should be contextualized alongside many other factors ranging from computational efficiency and data privacy to ethical values, and aspects that may influence the results (e.g., selection bias or differences in representativeness of the evaluation data across demographic groups). \n</p>\n<p>\nAs an adversarial example, the HEAL metric can be artificially improved by deliberately reducing model performance for the most advantaged subpopulation until performance for that subpopulation is worse than all others. For illustrative purposes, given subpopulations A and B where A has worse health outcomes than B, consider the choice between two models: Model 1 (M1) performs 5% better for subpopulation A than for subpopulation B. Model 2 (M2) performs 5% worse on subpopulation A than B. The HEAL metric would be higher for M1 because it prioritizes performance on a subpopulation with worse outcomes. However, M1 may have absolute performances of just 75% and 70% for subpopulations A and B respectively, while M2 has absolute performances of 75% and 80% for subpopulations A and B respectively. Choosing M1 over M2 would lead to worse overall performance for all subpopulations because some subpopulations are worse-off while no subpopulation is better-off. \n</p>\n<p>\nAccordingly, the HEAL metric should be used alongside a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\">Pareto condition</a> (discussed further in the paper), which restricts model changes so that outcomes for each subpopulation are either unchanged or improved compared to the status quo, and performance does not worsen for any subpopulation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework, in its current form, assesses the likelihood that an ML-based model prioritizes performance for subpopulations with respect to pre-existing health disparities for specific subpopulations. This differs from the goal of understanding whether ML will reduce disparities in outcomes across subpopulations in reality. Specifically, modeling improvements in outcomes requires a causal understanding of steps in the care journey that happen both before and after use of any given model. Future research is needed to address this gap.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThe HEAL framework enables a quantitative assessment of the likelihood that health AI technologies prioritize performance with respect to health disparities. The case study demonstrates how to apply the framework in the dermatological domain, indicating a high likelihood that model performance is prioritized with respect to health disparities across sex and race/ethnicity, but also revealing the potential for improvements for non-cancer conditions across age. The case study also illustrates limitations in the ability to apply all recommended aspects of the framework (e.g., mapping societal context, availability of data), thus highlighting the complexity of health equity considerations of ML-based tools. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis work is a proposed approach to address a grand challenge for AI and health equity, and may provide a useful evaluation framework not only during model development, but during pre-implementation and real-world monitoring stages, e.g., in the form of health equity dashboards. We hold that the strength of the HEAL framework is in its future application to various AI tools and use cases and its refinement in the process. Finally, we acknowledge that a successful approach towards understanding the impact of AI technologies on health equity needs to be more than a set of metrics. It will require a set of goals agreed upon by a community that represents those who will be most impacted by a model.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n<em>The research described here is joint work across many teams at Google.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Yun Zhu and Lijuan Liu, Software Engineers, Google Research Large language model (LLM) advancements have led to a new paradigm that unifies various natural language processing (NLP) tasks within an instruction-following framework. This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as T0, FLAN, and OPT-IML. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., \"Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier\u201d) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., \"Skier skis down the mountain\"). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Moreover, multi-task LLMs have exhibited remarkable task-wise generalization capabilities as they can address unseen tasks by understanding and solving brand-new instructions. The demonstration of the instruction-following pre-training of multi-task LLMs, e.g., FLAN. Pre-training tasks under this paradigm improves the performance for unseen tasks. Due to the complexity of understanding and solving various tasks solely using instructions, the size of multi-task LLMs typically spans from several billion parameters to hundreds of billions (e.g., FLAN-11B, T0-11B and OPT-IML-175B). As a result, operating such sizable models poses significant challenges because they demand considerable computational power and impose substantial requirements on the memory capacities of GPUs and TPUs, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Extensive storage is required to maintain a unique LLM copy for each downstream task. Moreover, the most powerful multi-task LLMs (e.g., FLAN-PaLM-540B) are closed-sourced, making them impossible to be adapted. However, in practical applications, harnessing a single multi-task LLM to manage all conceivable tasks in a zero-shot manner remains difficult, particularly when dealing with complex tasks, personalized tasks and those that cannot be succinctly defined using instructions. On the other hand, the size of downstream training data is usually insufficient to train a model well without incorporating rich prior knowledge. Hence, it is long desired to adapt LLMs with downstream supervision while bypassing storage, memory, and access issues. Certain parameter-efficient tuning strategies, including prompt tuning and adapters, substantially diminish storage requirements, but they still perform back-propagation through LLM parameters during the tuning process, thereby keeping their memory demands high. Additionally, some in-context learning techniques circumvent parameter tuning by integrating a limited number of supervised examples into the instruction. However, these techniques are constrained by the model's maximum input length, which permits only a few samples to guide task resolution. In \u201cCappy: Outperforming and Boosting Large Multi-Task LMs with a Small Scorer\u201d, presented at NeurIPS 2023, we propose a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. We introduce a lightweight pre-trained scorer, Cappy, based on continual pre-training on top of RoBERTa with merely 360 million parameters. Cappy takes in an instruction and a candidate response as input, and produces a score between 0 and 1, indicating an estimated correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serves as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy efficiently enables downstream supervision without requiring any finetuning, which avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters and reduces memory requirements. Finally, adaptation with Cappy doesn\u2019t require access to LLM parameters as it is compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as those only accessible via WebAPIs. Cappy takes an instruction and response pair as input and outputs a score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating an estimation of the correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Pre-training We begin with the same dataset collection, which includes 39 diverse datasets from PromptSource that were used to train T0. This collection encompasses a wide range of task types, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and summarization. Each dataset is associated with one or more templates that convert each instance from the original datasets into an instruction paired with its ground truth response. Cappy's regression modeling requires each pre-training data instance to include an instruction-response pair along with a correctness annotation for the response, so we produce a dataset with correctness annotations that range from 0 to 1. For every instance within a generation task, we leverage an existing multi-task LLM to generate multiple responses by sampling, conditioned on the given instruction. Subsequently, we assign an annotation to the pair formed by the instruction and every response, using the similarity between the response and the ground truth response of the instance. Specifically, we employ Rouge-L, a commonly-used metric for measuring overall multi-task performance that has demonstrated a strong alignment with human evaluation, to calculate this similarity as a form of weak supervision. As a result, we obtain an effective regression dataset of 160 million instances paired with correctness score annotations. The final Cappy model is the result of continuous pre-training using the regression dataset on top of the RoBERTa model. The pre-training of Cappy is conducted on Google's TPU-v4, with RedCoast, a lightweight toolkit for automating distributed training. Data augmentation with a multi-task LLM to construct a weakly supervised regression dataset for Cappy\u2019s pre-training and fine-tuning. Applying Cappy Cappy solves practical tasks within a candidate-selection mechanism. More specifically, given an instruction and a set of candidate responses, Cappy produces a score for each candidate response. This is achieved by inputting the instruction alongside each individual response, and then assigning the response with the highest score as its prediction. In classification tasks, all candidate responses are inherently predefined. For example, for an instruction of a sentiment classification task (e.g., \u201cBased on this review, would the user recommend this product?: \u2018Stunning even for the non-gamer.\u2019\u201d), the candidate responses are \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. In such scenarios, Cappy functions independently. On the other hand, in generation tasks, candidate responses are not pre-defined, requiring an existing multi-task LLM to yield the candidate responses. In this case, Cappy serves as an auxiliary component of the multi-task LLM, enhancing its decoding. Adapting multi-task LLMs with Cappy When there is available downstream training data, Cappy enables effective and efficient adaptation of multi-task LLMs on downstream tasks. Specifically, we fine-tune Cappy to integrate downstream task information into LLM predictions. This process involves creating a separate regression dataset specific to the downstream training data with the same data annotation process used to construct the pre-training data. As a result, the fine-tuned Cappy collaborates with a multi-task LLM, boosting the LLM's performance on the downstream task. In contrast to other LLM tuning strategies, adapting LLMs with Cappy significantly reduces the high demand for device memory as it avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters for downstream tasks. Moreover, Cappy adaptation does not rely on the access to LLM parameters, making it compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as the ones only accessible via WebAPIs. Compared with in-context learning approaches, which circumvent model tuning by attaching training examples to the instruction prefix, Cappy is not restricted by the LLM's maximum input length. Thus, Cappy can incorporate an unlimited number of downstream training examples. Cappy can also be applied with other adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning and in-context learning, further boosting their overall performance. Downstream adaptation comparison between Cappy and approaches that rely on an LLM\u2019s parameters, such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning. Cappy\u2019s application enhances multi-task LLMs. Results We assess Cappy\u2019s performance across eleven held-out language understanding classification tasks from PromptSource. We demonstrate that Cappy, with 360M parameters, outperforms OPT-175B and OPT-IML-30B, and matches the accuracy of the best existing multi-task LLMs (T0-11B and OPT-IML-175B). These findings highlight Cappy\u2019s capabilities and parameter efficiency, which can be credited to its scoring-based pre-training strategy that integrates contrastive information by differentiating between high-quality and low-quality responses. On the contrary, previous multi-task LLMs depend exclusively on teacher-forcing training that utilizes only the ground truth responses. The overall accuracy averaged over eleven test tasks from PromptSource. \u201cRM\u201d refers to a pre-trained RLHF reward model. Cappy matches the best ones among existing multi-task LLMs. We also examine the adaptation of multi-task LLMs with Cappy on complex tasks from BIG-Bench, a set of manually curated tasks that are considered beyond the capability of many LLMs. We focus on all the 45 generation BIG-Bench tasks, specifically those that do not offer pre-established answer choices. We evaluate the performance using the Rouge-L score (representing the overall similarity between model generations and corresponding ground truths) on every test set, reporting the average score across 45 tests. In this experiment, all variants of FLAN-T5 serve as the backbone LLMs, and the foundational FLAN-T5 models are frozen. These results, shown below, suggest that Cappy enhances the performance of FLAN-T5 models by a large margin, consistently outperforming the most effective baseline achieved through sample selection using self-scoring of the LLM itself. The averaged Rouge-L score over 45 complex tasks within BIG-Bench. The x-axis refers to FLAN-T5 models of different sizes. Every dashed line represents an approach working on FLAN-T5s. Self-scoring refers to using the cross-entropy of LLM to select responses. Cappy enhances the performance of FLAN-T5 models by a large margin. Conclusion We introduce Cappy, a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. In our experiments, we adapt a single LLM to several domains with Cappy. In the future, Cappy as a pre-trained model can potentially be used in other creative ways beyond on single LLMs. Acknowledgments Thanks to Bowen Tan, Jindong Chen, Lei Meng, Abhanshu Sharma and Ewa Dominowska for their valuable feedback.

More specifically, given an instruction and a set of candidate responses, Cappy produces a score for each candidate response. This is achieved by inputting the instruction alongside each individual response, and then assigning the response with the highest score as its prediction. In classification tasks, all candidate responses are inherently predefined. For example, for an instruction of a sentiment classification task (e.g., \u201cBased on this review, would the user recommend this product?: \u2018Stunning even for the non-gamer.\u2019\u201d), the candidate responses are \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. In such scenarios, Cappy functions independently. On the other hand, in generation tasks, candidate responses are not pre-defined, requiring an existing multi-task LLM to yield the candidate responses. In this case, Cappy serves as an auxiliary component of the multi-task LLM, enhancing its decoding.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Adapting multi-task LLMs with Cappy </h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen there is available downstream training data, Cappy enables effective and efficient adaptation of multi-task LLMs on downstream tasks. Specifically, we fine-tune Cappy to integrate downstream task information into LLM predictions. This process involves creating a separate regression dataset specific to the downstream training data with the same data annotation process used to construct the pre-training data. As a result, the fine-tuned Cappy collaborates with a multi-task LLM, boosting the LLM's performance on the downstream task.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn contrast to other LLM tuning strategies, adapting LLMs with Cappy significantly reduces the high demand for device memory as it avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters for downstream tasks.  Moreover, Cappy adaptation does not rely on the access to LLM parameters, making it compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as the ones only accessible via WebAPIs. Compared with in-context learning approaches, which circumvent model tuning by attaching training examples to the instruction prefix, Cappy is not restricted by the LLM's maximum input length. Thus, Cappy can incorporate an unlimited number of downstream training examples. Cappy can also be applied with other adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning and in-context learning, further boosting their overall performance.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s1999/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s16000/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Downstream adaptation comparison between Cappy and approaches that rely on an LLM\u2019s parameters, such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning.

This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML</a>. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., <em>\"</em>Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier<em>\u201d</em>) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., <em>\"</em>Skier skis down the mountain<em>\"</em>). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Moreover, multi-task LLMs have exhibited remarkable task-wise generalization capabilities as they can address unseen tasks by understanding and solving brand-new instructions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s640/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s16000/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The demonstration of the instruction-following pre-training of multi-task LLMs, e.g., FLAN. Pre-training tasks under this paradigm improves the performance for unseen tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nDue to the complexity of understanding and solving various tasks solely using instructions, the size of multi-task LLMs typically spans from several billion parameters to hundreds of billions (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN-11B</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0-11B</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML-175B</a>). As a result, operating such sizable models poses significant challenges because they demand considerable computational power and impose substantial requirements on the memory capacities of GPUs and TPUs, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Extensive storage is required to maintain a unique LLM copy for each downstream task. Moreover, the most powerful multi-task LLMs (e.g., FLAN-PaLM-540B) are closed-sourced, making them impossible to be adapted. However, in practical applications, harnessing a single multi-task LLM to manage all conceivable tasks in a zero-shot manner remains difficult, particularly when dealing with complex tasks, personalized tasks and those that cannot be succinctly defined using instructions. On the other hand, the size of downstream training data is usually insufficient to train a model well without incorporating rich prior knowledge. Hence, it is long desired to adapt LLMs with downstream supervision while bypassing storage, memory, and access issues. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nCertain <em>parameter-efficient tuning</em> strategies, including <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.353.pdf\">prompt tuning</a> and <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9\">adapters</a>, substantially diminish storage requirements, but they still perform back-propagation through LLM parameters during the tuning process, thereby keeping their memory demands high. Additionally, some <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf\">in-context learning</a></em> techniques circumvent parameter tuning by integrating a limited number of supervised examples into the instruction. However, these techniques are constrained by the model's maximum input length, which permits only a few samples to guide task resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06720\">Cappy: Outperforming and Boosting Large Multi-Task LMs with a Small Scorer</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/index.html\">NeurIPS 2023</a>, we propose a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. We introduce a lightweight pre-trained scorer, Cappy, based on continual pre-training on top of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> with merely 360 million parameters. Cappy takes in an instruction and a candidate response as input, and produces a score between 0 and 1, indicating an estimated correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serves as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy efficiently enables downstream supervision without requiring any finetuning, which avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters and reduces memory requirements. Finally, adaptation with Cappy doesn\u2019t require access to LLM parameters as it is compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as those only accessible via WebAPIs.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s1999/Cappy%20overview.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s16000/Cappy%20overview.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Cappy takes an instruction and response pair as input and outputs a score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating an estimation of the correctness of the response with respect to the instruction.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pre-training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe begin with the same dataset collection, which includes 39 diverse datasets from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01279\">PromptSource</a> that were used to train <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>.

This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML</a>. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., <em>\"</em>Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier<em>\u201d</em>) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., <em>\"</em>Skier skis down the mountain<em>\"</em>). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Moreover, multi-task LLMs have exhibited remarkable task-wise generalization capabilities as they can address unseen tasks by understanding and solving brand-new instructions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s640/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s16000/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The demonstration of the instruction-following pre-training of multi-task LLMs, e.g., FLAN. Pre-training tasks under this paradigm improves the performance for unseen tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nDue to the complexity of understanding and solving various tasks solely using instructions, the size of multi-task LLMs typically spans from several billion parameters to hundreds of billions (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN-11B</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0-11B</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML-175B</a>). As a result, operating such sizable models poses significant challenges because they demand considerable computational power and impose substantial requirements on the memory capacities of GPUs and TPUs, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Extensive storage is required to maintain a unique LLM copy for each downstream task. Moreover, the most powerful multi-task LLMs (e.g., FLAN-PaLM-540B) are closed-sourced, making them impossible to be adapted. However, in practical applications, harnessing a single multi-task LLM to manage all conceivable tasks in a zero-shot manner remains difficult, particularly when dealing with complex tasks, personalized tasks and those that cannot be succinctly defined using instructions. On the other hand, the size of downstream training data is usually insufficient to train a model well without incorporating rich prior knowledge. Hence, it is long desired to adapt LLMs with downstream supervision while bypassing storage, memory, and access issues. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nCertain <em>parameter-efficient tuning</em> strategies, including <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.353.pdf\">prompt tuning</a> and <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9\">adapters</a>, substantially diminish storage requirements, but they still perform back-propagation through LLM parameters during the tuning process, thereby keeping their memory demands high. Additionally, some <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf\">in-context learning</a></em> techniques circumvent parameter tuning by integrating a limited number of supervised examples into the instruction. However, these techniques are constrained by the model's maximum input length, which permits only a few samples to guide task resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06720\">Cappy: Outperforming and Boosting Large Multi-Task LMs with a Small Scorer</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/index.html\">NeurIPS 2023</a>, we propose a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. We introduce a lightweight pre-trained scorer, Cappy, based on continual pre-training on top of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> with merely 360 million parameters. Cappy takes in an instruction and a candidate response as input, and produces a score between 0 and 1, indicating an estimated correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serves as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy efficiently enables downstream supervision without requiring any finetuning, which avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters and reduces memory requirements. Finally, adaptation with Cappy doesn\u2019t require access to LLM parameters as it is compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as those only accessible via WebAPIs.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s1999/Cappy%20overview.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s16000/Cappy%20overview.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Cappy takes an instruction and response pair as input and outputs a score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating an estimation of the correctness of the response with respect to the instruction.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pre-training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe begin with the same dataset collection, which includes 39 diverse datasets from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01279\">PromptSource</a> that were used to train <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>.

Each dataset is associated with one or more templates that convert each instance from the original datasets into an instruction paired with its ground truth response.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCappy's regression modeling requires each pre-training data instance to include an instruction-response pair along with a correctness annotation for the response, so we produce a dataset with correctness annotations that range from 0 to 1. For every instance within a generation task, we leverage an existing multi-task LLM to generate multiple responses by sampling, conditioned on the given instruction. Subsequently, we assign an annotation to the pair formed by the instruction and every response, using the similarity between the response and the ground truth response of the instance. Specifically, we employ <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/\">Rouge-L</a>, a commonly-used metric for measuring overall multi-task performance that has demonstrated a strong alignment with human evaluation, to calculate this similarity as a form of weak supervision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a result, we obtain an effective regression dataset of 160 million instances paired with correctness score annotations.

This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML</a>. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., <em>\"</em>Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier<em>\u201d</em>) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., <em>\"</em>Skier skis down the mountain<em>\"</em>). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Moreover, multi-task LLMs have exhibited remarkable task-wise generalization capabilities as they can address unseen tasks by understanding and solving brand-new instructions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s640/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s16000/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The demonstration of the instruction-following pre-training of multi-task LLMs, e.g., FLAN. Pre-training tasks under this paradigm improves the performance for unseen tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nDue to the complexity of understanding and solving various tasks solely using instructions, the size of multi-task LLMs typically spans from several billion parameters to hundreds of billions (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN-11B</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0-11B</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML-175B</a>). As a result, operating such sizable models poses significant challenges because they demand considerable computational power and impose substantial requirements on the memory capacities of GPUs and TPUs, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Extensive storage is required to maintain a unique LLM copy for each downstream task. Moreover, the most powerful multi-task LLMs (e.g., FLAN-PaLM-540B) are closed-sourced, making them impossible to be adapted. However, in practical applications, harnessing a single multi-task LLM to manage all conceivable tasks in a zero-shot manner remains difficult, particularly when dealing with complex tasks, personalized tasks and those that cannot be succinctly defined using instructions. On the other hand, the size of downstream training data is usually insufficient to train a model well without incorporating rich prior knowledge. Hence, it is long desired to adapt LLMs with downstream supervision while bypassing storage, memory, and access issues. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nCertain <em>parameter-efficient tuning</em> strategies, including <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.353.pdf\">prompt tuning</a> and <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9\">adapters</a>, substantially diminish storage requirements, but they still perform back-propagation through LLM parameters during the tuning process, thereby keeping their memory demands high. Additionally, some <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf\">in-context learning</a></em> techniques circumvent parameter tuning by integrating a limited number of supervised examples into the instruction. However, these techniques are constrained by the model's maximum input length, which permits only a few samples to guide task resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06720\">Cappy: Outperforming and Boosting Large Multi-Task LMs with a Small Scorer</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/index.html\">NeurIPS 2023</a>, we propose a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. We introduce a lightweight pre-trained scorer, Cappy, based on continual pre-training on top of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> with merely 360 million parameters. Cappy takes in an instruction and a candidate response as input, and produces a score between 0 and 1, indicating an estimated correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serves as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy efficiently enables downstream supervision without requiring any finetuning, which avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters and reduces memory requirements. Finally, adaptation with Cappy doesn\u2019t require access to LLM parameters as it is compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as those only accessible via WebAPIs.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s1999/Cappy%20overview.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s16000/Cappy%20overview.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Cappy takes an instruction and response pair as input and outputs a score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating an estimation of the correctness of the response with respect to the instruction.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pre-training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe begin with the same dataset collection, which includes 39 diverse datasets from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01279\">PromptSource</a> that were used to train <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>. This collection encompasses a wide range of task types, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and summarization. Each dataset is associated with one or more templates that convert each instance from the original datasets into an instruction paired with its ground truth response.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCappy's regression modeling requires each pre-training data instance to include an instruction-response pair along with a correctness annotation for the response, so we produce a dataset with correctness annotations that range from 0 to 1. For every instance within a generation task, we leverage an existing multi-task LLM to generate multiple responses by sampling, conditioned on the given instruction. Subsequently, we assign an annotation to the pair formed by the instruction and every response, using the similarity between the response and the ground truth response of the instance. Specifically, we employ <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/\">Rouge-L</a>, a commonly-used metric for measuring overall multi-task performance that has demonstrated a strong alignment with human evaluation, to calculate this similarity as a form of weak supervision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a result, we obtain an effective regression dataset of 160 million instances paired with correctness score annotations. The final Cappy model is the result of continuous pre-training using the regression dataset on top of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> model.

More specifically, given an instruction and a set of candidate responses, Cappy produces a score for each candidate response. This is achieved by inputting the instruction alongside each individual response, and then assigning the response with the highest score as its prediction. In classification tasks, all candidate responses are inherently predefined. For example, for an instruction of a sentiment classification task (e.g., \u201cBased on this review, would the user recommend this product?: \u2018Stunning even for the non-gamer.\u2019\u201d), the candidate responses are \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. In such scenarios, Cappy functions independently. On the other hand, in generation tasks, candidate responses are not pre-defined, requiring an existing multi-task LLM to yield the candidate responses. In this case, Cappy serves as an auxiliary component of the multi-task LLM, enhancing its decoding.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Adapting multi-task LLMs with Cappy </h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen there is available downstream training data, Cappy enables effective and efficient adaptation of multi-task LLMs on downstream tasks. Specifically, we fine-tune Cappy to integrate downstream task information into LLM predictions. This process involves creating a separate regression dataset specific to the downstream training data with the same data annotation process used to construct the pre-training data. As a result, the fine-tuned Cappy collaborates with a multi-task LLM, boosting the LLM's performance on the downstream task.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn contrast to other LLM tuning strategies, adapting LLMs with Cappy significantly reduces the high demand for device memory as it avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters for downstream tasks.  Moreover, Cappy adaptation does not rely on the access to LLM parameters, making it compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as the ones only accessible via WebAPIs. Compared with in-context learning approaches, which circumvent model tuning by attaching training examples to the instruction prefix, Cappy is not restricted by the LLM's maximum input length. Thus, Cappy can incorporate an unlimited number of downstream training examples. Cappy can also be applied with other adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning and in-context learning, further boosting their overall performance.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s1999/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s16000/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Downstream adaptation comparison between Cappy and approaches that rely on an LLM\u2019s parameters, such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning.

This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML</a>. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., <em>\"</em>Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier<em>\u201d</em>) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., <em>\"</em>Skier skis down the mountain<em>\"</em>). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Moreover, multi-task LLMs have exhibited remarkable task-wise generalization capabilities as they can address unseen tasks by understanding and solving brand-new instructions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s640/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcacnhPA68XiEskvhExF4SGFh4997UZzwvhYfXt-ReGXtzfGTamLB3LZoYSh8WWuf1dmlBnNAUecAMhrBTOMVF6vxsw3BqY8Ld5xPgSdZY_cywScxxxQ5e6uwhawA5VYDEj6VtSyOTNGZtjdLXieeFV5OLiDk3bnB-xaz4MIbvUO-7RPadk8iQDv3206V/s16000/Cappy%20instruction-following.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The demonstration of the instruction-following pre-training of multi-task LLMs, e.g., FLAN. Pre-training tasks under this paradigm improves the performance for unseen tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nDue to the complexity of understanding and solving various tasks solely using instructions, the size of multi-task LLMs typically spans from several billion parameters to hundreds of billions (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416\">FLAN-11B</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0-11B</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12017\">OPT-IML-175B</a>). As a result, operating such sizable models poses significant challenges because they demand considerable computational power and impose substantial requirements on the memory capacities of GPUs and TPUs, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Extensive storage is required to maintain a unique LLM copy for each downstream task. Moreover, the most powerful multi-task LLMs (e.g., FLAN-PaLM-540B) are closed-sourced, making them impossible to be adapted. However, in practical applications, harnessing a single multi-task LLM to manage all conceivable tasks in a zero-shot manner remains difficult, particularly when dealing with complex tasks, personalized tasks and those that cannot be succinctly defined using instructions. On the other hand, the size of downstream training data is usually insufficient to train a model well without incorporating rich prior knowledge. Hence, it is long desired to adapt LLMs with downstream supervision while bypassing storage, memory, and access issues. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nCertain <em>parameter-efficient tuning</em> strategies, including <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.353.pdf\">prompt tuning</a> and <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9\">adapters</a>, substantially diminish storage requirements, but they still perform back-propagation through LLM parameters during the tuning process, thereby keeping their memory demands high. Additionally, some <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf\">in-context learning</a></em> techniques circumvent parameter tuning by integrating a limited number of supervised examples into the instruction. However, these techniques are constrained by the model's maximum input length, which permits only a few samples to guide task resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06720\">Cappy: Outperforming and Boosting Large Multi-Task LMs with a Small Scorer</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/index.html\">NeurIPS 2023</a>, we propose a novel approach that enhances the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. We introduce a lightweight pre-trained scorer, Cappy, based on continual pre-training on top of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> with merely 360 million parameters. Cappy takes in an instruction and a candidate response as input, and produces a score between 0 and 1, indicating an estimated correctness of the response with respect to the instruction. Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serves as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy efficiently enables downstream supervision without requiring any finetuning, which avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters and reduces memory requirements. Finally, adaptation with Cappy doesn\u2019t require access to LLM parameters as it is compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as those only accessible via WebAPIs.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s1999/Cappy%20overview.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKxfEf2em6vxULs9wHGOB2jU7AiGMhUiEsJENdGWjB-8AMW6T2uRUrp3k3776491wzNsQCEk2T26AmiPNaKi-mfiIRNHe7JKZuR4ETQbHrM5h1knDNDBZ-qPw6sPGhtA4v0dz9YtKbHyoXPWEgYkY6r-tv8brepN8_Qq7MjCIwGUaYw5LmJMY4KLxu28ku/s16000/Cappy%20overview.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Cappy takes an instruction and response pair as input and outputs a score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating an estimation of the correctness of the response with respect to the instruction.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pre-training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe begin with the same dataset collection, which includes 39 diverse datasets from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01279\">PromptSource</a> that were used to train <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207\">T0</a>. This collection encompasses a wide range of task types, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and summarization. Each dataset is associated with one or more templates that convert each instance from the original datasets into an instruction paired with its ground truth response.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCappy's regression modeling requires each pre-training data instance to include an instruction-response pair along with a correctness annotation for the response, so we produce a dataset with correctness annotations that range from 0 to 1. For every instance within a generation task, we leverage an existing multi-task LLM to generate multiple responses by sampling, conditioned on the given instruction. Subsequently, we assign an annotation to the pair formed by the instruction and every response, using the similarity between the response and the ground truth response of the instance. Specifically, we employ <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/\">Rouge-L</a>, a commonly-used metric for measuring overall multi-task performance that has demonstrated a strong alignment with human evaluation, to calculate this similarity as a form of weak supervision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a result, we obtain an effective regression dataset of 160 million instances paired with correctness score annotations. The final Cappy model is the result of continuous pre-training using the regression dataset on top of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\">RoBERTa</a> model.

More specifically, given an instruction and a set of candidate responses, Cappy produces a score for each candidate response. This is achieved by inputting the instruction alongside each individual response, and then assigning the response with the highest score as its prediction. In classification tasks, all candidate responses are inherently predefined. For example, for an instruction of a sentiment classification task (e.g., \u201cBased on this review, would the user recommend this product?: \u2018Stunning even for the non-gamer.\u2019\u201d), the candidate responses are \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. In such scenarios, Cappy functions independently. On the other hand, in generation tasks, candidate responses are not pre-defined, requiring an existing multi-task LLM to yield the candidate responses. In this case, Cappy serves as an auxiliary component of the multi-task LLM, enhancing its decoding.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Adapting multi-task LLMs with Cappy </h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen there is available downstream training data, Cappy enables effective and efficient adaptation of multi-task LLMs on downstream tasks. Specifically, we fine-tune Cappy to integrate downstream task information into LLM predictions. This process involves creating a separate regression dataset specific to the downstream training data with the same data annotation process used to construct the pre-training data. As a result, the fine-tuned Cappy collaborates with a multi-task LLM, boosting the LLM's performance on the downstream task.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn contrast to other LLM tuning strategies, adapting LLMs with Cappy significantly reduces the high demand for device memory as it avoids the need for back-propagation through LLM parameters for downstream tasks.  Moreover, Cappy adaptation does not rely on the access to LLM parameters, making it compatible with closed-source multi-task LLMs, such as the ones only accessible via WebAPIs. Compared with in-context learning approaches, which circumvent model tuning by attaching training examples to the instruction prefix, Cappy is not restricted by the LLM's maximum input length. Thus, Cappy can incorporate an unlimited number of downstream training examples. Cappy can also be applied with other adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning and in-context learning, further boosting their overall performance.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s1999/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf1zSOPmuCuPWHPOXYRczk86xESIKANYJN7jUqjkoSQabuQrDyLEfyLCXG0eAEHG1xiYL6jrZ8iMC14a2FhQs7XNwyncRdCyfIRa3KlLx3786yfSXfP9pEwtUEJ6ax7l5J8MchxjH9cV_hKqQFanTh3kNCs_JHYw0vsMOFi09-69-anFrqJShRgYFcKvfe/s16000/Cappy%20downstream%20adaptation.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Downstream adaptation comparison between Cappy and approaches that rely on an LLM\u2019s parameters, such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Bahare Fatemi and Bryan Perozzi, Research Scientists, Google Research Imagine all the things around you \u2014 your friends, tools in your kitchen, or even the parts of your bike. They are all connected in different ways. In computer science, the term graph is used to describe connections between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (the objects themselves) and edges (connections between two nodes, indicating a relationship between them). Graphs are everywhere now. The internet itself is a giant graph of websites linked together. Even the knowledge search engines use is organized in a graph-like way. Furthermore, consider the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence \u2014 such as chatbots that can write stories in seconds, and even software that can interpret medical reports. This exciting progress is largely thanks to large language models (LLMs). New LLM technology is constantly being developed for different uses. Since graphs are everywhere and LLM technology is on the rise, in \u201cTalk like a Graph: Encoding Graphs for Large Language Models\u201d, presented at ICLR 2024, we present a way to teach powerful LLMs how to better reason with graph information. Graphs are a useful way to organize information, but LLMs are mostly trained on regular text. The objective is to test different techniques to see what works best and gain practical insights. Translating graphs into text that LLMs can understand is a remarkably complex task. The difficulty stems from the inherent complexity of graph structures with multiple nodes and the intricate web of edges that connect them. Our work studies how to take a graph and translate it into a format that an LLM can understand. We also design a benchmark called GraphQA to study different approaches on different graph reasoning problems and show how to phrase a graph-related problem in a way that enables the LLM to solve the graph problem. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: 1) the graph encoding method, 2) the nature of the graph task itself, and 3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These findings give us clues on how to best represent graphs for LLMs. Picking the right method can make the LLM up to 60% better at graph tasks! Pictured, the process of encoding a graph as text using two different approaches and feeding the text and a question about the graph to the LLM. Graphs as text To be able to systematically find out what is the best way to translate a graph to text, we first design a benchmark called GraphQA. Think of GraphQA as an exam designed to evaluate powerful LLMs on graph-specific problems. We want to see how well LLMs can understand and solve problems that involve graphs in different setups. To create a comprehensive and realistic exam for LLMs, we don\u2019t just use one type of graph, we use a mix of graphs ensuring breadth in the number of connections. This is mainly because different graph types make solving such problems easier or harder. This way, GraphQA can help expose biases in how an LLM thinks about the graphs, and the whole exam gets closer to a realistic setup that LLMs might encounter in the real world. Overview of our framework for reasoning with graphs using LLMs. GraphQA focuses on simple tasks related to graphs, like checking if an edge exists, calculating the number of nodes or edges, finding nodes that are connected to a specific node, and checking for cycles in a graph. These tasks might seem basic, but they require understanding the relationships between nodes and edges. By covering different types of challenges, from identifying patterns to creating new connections, GraphQA helps models learn how to analyze graphs effectively. These basic tasks are crucial for more complex reasoning on graphs, like finding the shortest path between nodes, detecting communities, or identifying influential nodes. Additionally, GraphQA includes generating random graphs using various algorithms like Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, scale-free networks, Barabasi-Albert model, and stochastic block model, as well as simpler graph structures like paths, complete graphs, and star graphs, providing a diverse set of data for training. When working with graphs, we also need to find ways to ask graph-related questions that LLMs can understand. Prompting heuristics are different strategies for doing this. Let's break down the common ones: Zero-shot: simply describe the task (\"Is there a cycle in this graph?\") and tell the LLM to go for it. No examples provided. Few-shot: This is like giving the LLM a mini practice test before the real deal. We provide a few example graph questions and their correct answers. Chain-of-Thought: Here, we show the LLM how to break down a problem step-by-step with examples. The goal is to teach it to generate its own \"thought process\" when faced with new graphs. Zero-CoT: Similar to CoT, but instead of training examples, we give the LLM a simple prompt, like \"Let's think step-by-step,\" to trigger its own problem-solving breakdown. BAG (build a graph): This is specifically for graph tasks. We add the phrase \"Let's build a graph...\" to the description, helping the LLM focus on the graph structure. We explored different ways to translate graphs into text that LLMs can work with. Our key questions were: Node encoding: How do we represent individual nodes? Options tested include simple integers, common names (people, characters), and letters. Edge encoding: How do we describe the relationships between nodes? Methods involved parenthesis notation, phrases like \"are friends\", and symbolic representations like arrows. Various node and edge encodings were combined systematically. This led to functions like the ones in the following figure: Examples of graph encoding functions used to encode graphs via text. Analysis and results We carried out three key experiments: one to test how LLMs handle graph tasks, and two to understand how the size of the LLM and different graph shapes affected performance. We run all our experiments on GraphQA. How LLMs handle graph tasks In this experiment, we tested how well pre-trained LLMs tackle graph problems like identifying connections, cycles, and node degrees. Here is what we learned: LLMs struggle: On most of these basic tasks, LLMs did not do much better than a random guess. Encoding matters significantly: How we represent the graph as text has a great effect on LLM performance. The \"incident\" encoding excelled for most of the tasks in general. Our results are summarized in the following chart. Comparison of various graph encoder functions based on their accuracy on different graph tasks. The main conclusion from this figure is that the graph encoding functions matter significantly. Bigger is (usually) better In this experiment, we wanted to see if the size of the LLM (in terms of the number of parameters) affects how well they can handle graph problems. For that, we tested the same graph tasks on the XXS, XS, S, and L sizes of PaLM 2. Here is a summary of our findings: In general, bigger models did better on graph reasoning tasks. It seems like the extra parameters gave them space to learn more complex patterns. Oddly, size didn't matter as much for the \u201cedge existence\u201d task (finding out if two nodes in a graph are connected). Even the biggest LLM couldn't consistently beat a simple baseline solution on the cycle check problem (finding out if a graph contains a cycle or not). This shows LLMs still have room to improve with certain graph tasks. Effect of model capacity on graph reasoning task for PaLM 2-XXS, XS, S, and L. Do different graph shapes confuse LLMs We wondered if the \"shape\" of a graph (how nodes are connected) influences how well LLMs can solve problems on it. Think of the following figure as different examples of graph shapes. Samples of graphs generated with different graph generators from GraphQA. ER, BA, SBM, and SFN refers to Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert, Stochastic Block Model, and Scale-Free Network respectively. We found that graph structure has a big impact on LLM performance. For example, in a task asking if a cycle exists, LLMs did great on tightly interconnected graphs (cycles are common there) but struggled on path graphs (where cycles never happen). Interestingly, providing some mixed examples helped it adapt. For instance, for cycle check, we added some examples containing a cycle and some examples with no cycles as few-shot examples in our prompt. Similar patterns occurred with other tasks. Comparing different graph generators on different graph tasks. The main observation here is that graph structure has a significant impact on the LLM\u2019s performance. ER, BA, SBM, and SFN refers to Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert, Stochastic Block Model, and Scale-Free Network respectively. Conclusion In short, we dug deep into how to best represent graphs as text so LLMs can understand them. We found three major factors that make a difference: How to translate the graph to text: how we represent the graph as text significantly influences LLM performance. The incident encoding excelled for most of the tasks in general.. Task type: Certain types of graph questions tend to be harder for LLMs, even with a good translation from graph to text. Graph structure: Surprisingly, the \"shape\" of the graph that on which we do inference (dense with connections, sparse, etc.) influences how well an LLM does. This study revealed key insights about how to prepare graphs for LLMs. The right encoding techniques can significantly boost an LLM's accuracy on graph problems (ranging from around 5% to over 60% improvement). Our new benchmark, GraphQA, will help drive further research in this area.

They are all connected in different ways. In computer science, the term <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\">graph</a> </em>is used to describe connections between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (the objects themselves) and edges (connections between two nodes, indicating a  relationship between them). Graphs are everywhere now. The internet itself is a giant graph of websites linked together. Even the knowledge search engines use is organized in a graph-like way.\n</p><a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n\n<p>\nFurthermore, consider the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence \u2014 such as chatbots that can write stories in seconds, and even software that can interpret medical reports. This exciting progress is largely thanks to large language models (LLMs). New LLM technology is constantly being developed for different uses. \n</p>\n<p>\nSince graphs are everywhere and LLM technology is on the rise, in \u201c<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=IuXR1CCrSi\">Talk like a Graph: Encoding Graphs for Large Language Models</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://iclr.cc/\">ICLR 2024</a>, we present a way to teach powerful LLMs how to better reason with graph information. Graphs are a useful way to organize information, but LLMs are mostly trained on regular text. The objective is to test different techniques to see what works best and gain practical insights. Translating graphs into text that LLMs can understand is a remarkably complex task. The difficulty stems from the inherent complexity of graph structures with multiple nodes and the intricate web of edges that connect them. Our work studies how to take a graph and translate it into a format that an LLM can understand. We also design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em> to study different approaches on different graph reasoning problems and show how to <em>phrase</em> a graph-related problem in a way that enables the LLM to solve the graph problem. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: 1) the graph encoding method, 2) the nature of the graph task itself, and 3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These findings give us clues on how to best represent graphs for LLMs. Picking the right method can make the LLM up to 60% better at graph tasks!\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s1600/image7.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s16000/image7.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pictured, the process of encoding a graph as text using two different approaches and feeding the text and a question about the graph to the LLM.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Graphs as text</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo be able to systematically find out what is the best way to translate a graph to text, we first design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em>.

They are all connected in different ways. In computer science, the term <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\">graph</a> </em>is used to describe connections between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (the objects themselves) and edges (connections between two nodes, indicating a  relationship between them). Graphs are everywhere now. The internet itself is a giant graph of websites linked together. Even the knowledge search engines use is organized in a graph-like way.\n</p><a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n\n<p>\nFurthermore, consider the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence \u2014 such as chatbots that can write stories in seconds, and even software that can interpret medical reports. This exciting progress is largely thanks to large language models (LLMs). New LLM technology is constantly being developed for different uses. \n</p>\n<p>\nSince graphs are everywhere and LLM technology is on the rise, in \u201c<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=IuXR1CCrSi\">Talk like a Graph: Encoding Graphs for Large Language Models</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://iclr.cc/\">ICLR 2024</a>, we present a way to teach powerful LLMs how to better reason with graph information. Graphs are a useful way to organize information, but LLMs are mostly trained on regular text. The objective is to test different techniques to see what works best and gain practical insights. Translating graphs into text that LLMs can understand is a remarkably complex task. The difficulty stems from the inherent complexity of graph structures with multiple nodes and the intricate web of edges that connect them. Our work studies how to take a graph and translate it into a format that an LLM can understand. We also design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em> to study different approaches on different graph reasoning problems and show how to <em>phrase</em> a graph-related problem in a way that enables the LLM to solve the graph problem. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: 1) the graph encoding method, 2) the nature of the graph task itself, and 3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These findings give us clues on how to best represent graphs for LLMs. Picking the right method can make the LLM up to 60% better at graph tasks!\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s1600/image7.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s16000/image7.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pictured, the process of encoding a graph as text using two different approaches and feeding the text and a question about the graph to the LLM.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Graphs as text</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo be able to systematically find out what is the best way to translate a graph to text, we first design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em>. Think of GraphQA as an exam designed to evaluate powerful LLMs on graph-specific problems. We want to see how well LLMs can understand and solve problems that involve graphs in different setups. To create a comprehensive and realistic exam for LLMs, we don\u2019t just use one type of graph, we use a mix of graphs ensuring breadth in the number of connections. This is mainly because different graph types make solving such problems easier or harder. This way, GraphQA can help expose biases in how an LLM thinks about the graphs, and the whole exam gets closer to a realistic setup that LLMs might encounter in the real world.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlHJKqbwgQJFMK4siQJH_Ggag9B8lStCQ4CcXk8iPnNPgxGPLYl_LTrIfjxuP7vKKtzJITlltZ5pcq7RElYNVQJ8PKi9Sr3ctigYfLs6SBlMAEhDHP2nV2PJ-uLhJxUkZ3MdAGV7R8rjw0u6Y8QTCwrMTyqz7tuxzb3TnIFabf4ZZbsSQ95MSboOA42i4w/s1368/image6.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlHJKqbwgQJFMK4siQJH_Ggag9B8lStCQ4CcXk8iPnNPgxGPLYl_LTrIfjxuP7vKKtzJITlltZ5pcq7RElYNVQJ8PKi9Sr3ctigYfLs6SBlMAEhDHP2nV2PJ-uLhJxUkZ3MdAGV7R8rjw0u6Y8QTCwrMTyqz7tuxzb3TnIFabf4ZZbsSQ95MSboOA42i4w/s16000/image6.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Overview of our framework for reasoning with graphs using LLMs.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>\nGraphQA focuses on simple tasks related to graphs, like checking if an edge exists, calculating the number of nodes or edges, finding nodes that are connected to a specific node, and checking for cycles in a graph. These tasks might seem basic, but they require understanding the relationships between nodes and edges. By covering different types of challenges, from identifying patterns to creating new connections, GraphQA helps models learn how to analyze graphs effectively. These basic tasks are crucial for more complex reasoning on graphs, like finding the shortest path between nodes, detecting communities, or identifying influential nodes. Additionally, GraphQA includes generating random graphs using various algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network\">scale-free networks</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model\">Barabasi-Albert model</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_block_model\">stochastic block model</a>, as well as simpler graph structures like paths, complete graphs, and star graphs, providing a diverse set of data for training.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen working with graphs, we also need to find ways to ask graph-related questions that LLMs can understand.  <em>Prompting heuristics</em> are different strategies for doing this. Let's break down the common ones:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Zero-shot</em>: simply describe the task (\"Is there a cycle in this graph?\") and tell the LLM to go for it. No examples provided.\n\n</li><li><em>Few-shot</em>: This is like giving the LLM a mini practice test before the real deal. We provide a few example graph questions and their correct answers.\n\n</li><li><em>Chain-of-Thought</em>: Here, we show the LLM how to break down a problem step-by-step with examples. The goal is to teach it to generate its own \"thought process\" when faced with new graphs.\n\n</li><li><em>Zero-CoT</em>: Similar to CoT, but instead of training examples, we give the LLM a simple prompt, like \"Let's think step-by-step,\" to trigger its own problem-solving breakdown.\n\n</li><li><em>BAG (build a graph)</em>: This is specifically for graph tasks. We add the phrase \"Let's build a graph...\" to the description, helping the LLM focus on the graph structure.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe explored different ways to translate graphs into text that LLMs can work with. Our key questions were:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Node encoding</em>: How do we represent individual nodes? Options tested include simple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer\">integers</a>, common names (people, characters), and letters.\n\n</li><li><em>Edge encoding</em>: How do we describe the relationships between nodes? Methods involved parenthesis notation, phrases like \"are friends\", and symbolic representations like arrows.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nVarious node and edge encodings were combined systematically. This led to functions like the ones in the following figure:\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHqSBznT1daPxVFMf0ZOR0uiZpjYrTG46t71FWy4tq5IMh-Ijhbzp_toJVmvp72FGrtoQXFkhCaaDVkhCzQXzcfRUPvW7151j22mmVxejpNJdO6VcvdHOkmEye_1zEBtfvAVgSw6RPFOiCpdo9LnetLvgrS-OL7IZPRLpBaCWGny_mzk6wpZcHDY-oS1ts/s855/image1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHqSBznT1daPxVFMf0ZOR0uiZpjYrTG46t71FWy4tq5IMh-Ijhbzp_toJVmvp72FGrtoQXFkhCaaDVkhCzQXzcfRUPvW7151j22mmVxejpNJdO6VcvdHOkmEye_1zEBtfvAVgSw6RPFOiCpdo9LnetLvgrS-OL7IZPRLpBaCWGny_mzk6wpZcHDY-oS1ts/w640-h302/image1.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Examples of graph encoding functions used to encode graphs via text.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Analysis and results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe carried out three key experiments: one to test how LLMs handle graph tasks, and two to understand how the size of the LLM and different graph shapes affected performance.

They are all connected in different ways. In computer science, the term <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\">graph</a> </em>is used to describe connections between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (the objects themselves) and edges (connections between two nodes, indicating a  relationship between them). Graphs are everywhere now. The internet itself is a giant graph of websites linked together. Even the knowledge search engines use is organized in a graph-like way.\n</p><a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n\n<p>\nFurthermore, consider the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence \u2014 such as chatbots that can write stories in seconds, and even software that can interpret medical reports. This exciting progress is largely thanks to large language models (LLMs). New LLM technology is constantly being developed for different uses. \n</p>\n<p>\nSince graphs are everywhere and LLM technology is on the rise, in \u201c<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=IuXR1CCrSi\">Talk like a Graph: Encoding Graphs for Large Language Models</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://iclr.cc/\">ICLR 2024</a>, we present a way to teach powerful LLMs how to better reason with graph information. Graphs are a useful way to organize information, but LLMs are mostly trained on regular text. The objective is to test different techniques to see what works best and gain practical insights. Translating graphs into text that LLMs can understand is a remarkably complex task. The difficulty stems from the inherent complexity of graph structures with multiple nodes and the intricate web of edges that connect them. Our work studies how to take a graph and translate it into a format that an LLM can understand. We also design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em> to study different approaches on different graph reasoning problems and show how to <em>phrase</em> a graph-related problem in a way that enables the LLM to solve the graph problem. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: 1) the graph encoding method, 2) the nature of the graph task itself, and 3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These findings give us clues on how to best represent graphs for LLMs. Picking the right method can make the LLM up to 60% better at graph tasks!\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s1600/image7.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAnieWluvqGQtyh_L3a_Y7XfYUR2dBRGpQf58DpzJfIrkyM2JnwxiCOvTzDidvP-GtbtRe4NsJUEFlzpW8nQbf8WGQD6P_C2jjsRZeLiyDSO8QF8IiGCRYnSa4MxruywJt60gU8KrH6w87ZoBXsGbPmyWDx01j1nqSCaEtfFeNTmAWSLcVVcND8XuzoaHb/s16000/image7.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pictured, the process of encoding a graph as text using two different approaches and feeding the text and a question about the graph to the LLM.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Graphs as text</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo be able to systematically find out what is the best way to translate a graph to text, we first design a benchmark called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graphqa\">GraphQA</a></em>. Think of GraphQA as an exam designed to evaluate powerful LLMs on graph-specific problems. We want to see how well LLMs can understand and solve problems that involve graphs in different setups. To create a comprehensive and realistic exam for LLMs, we don\u2019t just use one type of graph, we use a mix of graphs ensuring breadth in the number of connections. This is mainly because different graph types make solving such problems easier or harder. This way, GraphQA can help expose biases in how an LLM thinks about the graphs, and the whole exam gets closer to a realistic setup that LLMs might encounter in the real world.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlHJKqbwgQJFMK4siQJH_Ggag9B8lStCQ4CcXk8iPnNPgxGPLYl_LTrIfjxuP7vKKtzJITlltZ5pcq7RElYNVQJ8PKi9Sr3ctigYfLs6SBlMAEhDHP2nV2PJ-uLhJxUkZ3MdAGV7R8rjw0u6Y8QTCwrMTyqz7tuxzb3TnIFabf4ZZbsSQ95MSboOA42i4w/s1368/image6.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlHJKqbwgQJFMK4siQJH_Ggag9B8lStCQ4CcXk8iPnNPgxGPLYl_LTrIfjxuP7vKKtzJITlltZ5pcq7RElYNVQJ8PKi9Sr3ctigYfLs6SBlMAEhDHP2nV2PJ-uLhJxUkZ3MdAGV7R8rjw0u6Y8QTCwrMTyqz7tuxzb3TnIFabf4ZZbsSQ95MSboOA42i4w/s16000/image6.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Overview of our framework for reasoning with graphs using LLMs.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>\nGraphQA focuses on simple tasks related to graphs, like checking if an edge exists, calculating the number of nodes or edges, finding nodes that are connected to a specific node, and checking for cycles in a graph. These tasks might seem basic, but they require understanding the relationships between nodes and edges. By covering different types of challenges, from identifying patterns to creating new connections, GraphQA helps models learn how to analyze graphs effectively. These basic tasks are crucial for more complex reasoning on graphs, like finding the shortest path between nodes, detecting communities, or identifying influential nodes. Additionally, GraphQA includes generating random graphs using various algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network\">scale-free networks</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model\">Barabasi-Albert model</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_block_model\">stochastic block model</a>, as well as simpler graph structures like paths, complete graphs, and star graphs, providing a diverse set of data for training.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen working with graphs, we also need to find ways to ask graph-related questions that LLMs can understand.  <em>Prompting heuristics</em> are different strategies for doing this. Let's break down the common ones:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Zero-shot</em>: simply describe the task (\"Is there a cycle in this graph?\") and tell the LLM to go for it. No examples provided.\n\n</li><li><em>Few-shot</em>: This is like giving the LLM a mini practice test before the real deal. We provide a few example graph questions and their correct answers.\n\n</li><li><em>Chain-of-Thought</em>: Here, we show the LLM how to break down a problem step-by-step with examples. The goal is to teach it to generate its own \"thought process\" when faced with new graphs.\n\n</li><li><em>Zero-CoT</em>: Similar to CoT, but instead of training examples, we give the LLM a simple prompt, like \"Let's think step-by-step,\" to trigger its own problem-solving breakdown.\n\n</li><li><em>BAG (build a graph)</em>: This is specifically for graph tasks. We add the phrase \"Let's build a graph...\" to the description, helping the LLM focus on the graph structure.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe explored different ways to translate graphs into text that LLMs can work with. Our key questions were:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Node encoding</em>: How do we represent individual nodes? Options tested include simple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer\">integers</a>, common names (people, characters), and letters.\n\n</li><li><em>Edge encoding</em>: How do we describe the relationships between nodes? Methods involved parenthesis notation, phrases like \"are friends\", and symbolic representations like arrows.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nVarious node and edge encodings were combined systematically. This led to functions like the ones in the following figure:\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHqSBznT1daPxVFMf0ZOR0uiZpjYrTG46t71FWy4tq5IMh-Ijhbzp_toJVmvp72FGrtoQXFkhCaaDVkhCzQXzcfRUPvW7151j22mmVxejpNJdO6VcvdHOkmEye_1zEBtfvAVgSw6RPFOiCpdo9LnetLvgrS-OL7IZPRLpBaCWGny_mzk6wpZcHDY-oS1ts/s855/image1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHqSBznT1daPxVFMf0ZOR0uiZpjYrTG46t71FWy4tq5IMh-Ijhbzp_toJVmvp72FGrtoQXFkhCaaDVkhCzQXzcfRUPvW7151j22mmVxejpNJdO6VcvdHOkmEye_1zEBtfvAVgSw6RPFOiCpdo9LnetLvgrS-OL7IZPRLpBaCWGny_mzk6wpZcHDY-oS1ts/w640-h302/image1.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Examples of graph encoding functions used to encode graphs via text.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Analysis and results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe carried out three key experiments: one to test how LLMs handle graph tasks, and two to understand how the size of the LLM and different graph shapes affected performance.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in natural language processing tasks but face challenges interpreting the structured data inherent to tables.",
      "summary_original": "Posted by Zilong Wang, Student Researcher, and Chen-Yu Lee, Research Scientist, Cloud AI Team People use tables every day to organize and interpret complex information in a structured, easily accessible format. Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in natural language processing (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse natural language understanding (NLU) tasks by generating reliable reasoning chains, as shown in works like Chain-of-Thought and Least-to-Most. However, the most suitable way for LLMs to reason over tabular data remains an open question. In \u201cChain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding\u201d, we propose a framework to tackle table understanding tasks, where we train LLMs to outline their reasoning step by step, updating a given table iteratively to reflect each part of a thought process, akin to how people solve the table-based problems. This enables the LLM to transform the table into simpler and more manageable segments so that it can understand and analyze each part of the table in depth. This approach has yielded significant improvements and achieved new state-of-the-art results on the WikiTQ, TabFact, and FeTaQA benchmarks. The figure below shows the high-level overview of the proposed Chain-of-Table and other methods. Given a complex table where a cyclist\u2019s nationality and name are in the same cell, (a) generic, multi-step reasoning is unable to provide the correct answer (b) program-aided reasoning generates and executes programs (e.g., SQL queries) to deliver the answer, but falls short in accurately addressing the question. In contrast, (c) Chain-of-Table iteratively samples a chain of operations that effectively transform the complex table into a version specifically tailored to the question. Chain-of-Table In Chain-of-Table, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and to update the table to represent its reasoning chain over tabular data. This enables LLMs to dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, which provides a more structured and clear representation of the reasoning process for a given problem and enables more accurate and reliable predictions from the LLM. For example, when asked, \u201cWhich actor has the most NAACP image awards?\u201d the Chain-of-Table framework prompts an LLM to generate tabular operations mirroring tabular reasoning processes. It first identifies the relevant columns. Then, it aggregates rows based on shared content. Finally, it reorders the aggregated results to yield a final table that clearly answers the posed question. These operations transform the table to align with the question presented. To balance performance with computational expense on large tables, we construct the operation chain according to a subset of tabular rows.. Meanwhile, the step-by-step operations reveal the underlying reasoning process through the display of intermediate results from the tabular operations, fostering enhanced interpretability and understanding. Illustration of the tabular reasoning process in Chain-of-Table. This iterative process involves dynamically planning an operation chain and accurately storing intermediate results in the transformed tables. These intermediate tables serve as a tabular thought process that can guide the LLM to land to the correct answer more reliably. Chain-of-Table consists of three main stages. In the first stage, it instructs the LLM to dynamically plan the next operation by in-context learning. Specifically, the prompt involves three components as shown in the following figure: The question Q: \u201cWhich country had the most cyclists finish in the top 3?\u201d The operation history chain: f_add_col(Country) and f_select_row(1, 2, 3). The latest intermediate table T: the transformed intermediate table. By providing the triplet (T, Q, chain) in the prompt, the LLM can observe the previous tabular reasoning process and select the next operation from the operation pool to complete the reasoning chain step by step. Illustration of how Chain-of-Table selects the next operation from the operation pool and generates the arguments for the operation.(a) Chain-of-Table samples the next operation from the operation pool. (b) It takes the selected operation as input and generates its arguments. After the next operation f is determined, in the second stage, we need to generate the arguments. As above, Chain-of-Table considers three components in the prompt as shown in the figure: (1) the question, (2) the selected operation and its required arguments, and (3) the latest intermediate table. For instance, when the operation f_group_by is selected, it requires a header name as its argument. The LLM selects a suitable header within the table. Equipped with the selected operation and the generated arguments, Chain-of-Table executes the operation and constructs a new intermediate table for the following reasoning. Chain-of-Table iterates the previous two stages to plan the next operation and generate the required arguments. During this process, we create an operation chain acting as a proxy for the tabular reasoning steps. These operations generate intermediate tables presenting the results of each step to the LLM. Consequently, the output table contains comprehensive information about the intermediate phases of tabular reasoning. In our final stage, we employ this output table in formulating the final query and prompt the LLM along with the question for the final answer. Experimental setup We use PaLM 2-S and GPT 3.5 as the backbone LLMs and conduct the experiments on three public table understanding benchmarks: WikiTQ, TabFact, and FeTaQA. WikiTQ and FeTaQA are datasets for table-based question answering. TabFact is a table-based fact verification benchmark. In this blogpost, we will focus on the results on WikiTQ and TabFact. We compare Chain-of-Table with the generic reasoning methods (e.g., End-to-End QA, Few-Shot QA, and Chain-of-Thought) and the program-aided methods (e.g., Text-to-SQL, Binder, and Dater). More accurate answers Compared to the generic reasoning methods and program-aided reasoning methods, Chain-of-Table achieves better performance across PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5. This is attributed to the dynamically sampled operations and the informative intermediate tables. Understanding results on WikiTQ and TabFact with PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 compared with various models. Better robustness on harder questions In Chain-of-Table, longer operation chains indicate the higher difficulty and complexity of the questions and their corresponding tables. We categorize the test samples according to their operation lengths in Chain-of-Table. We compare Chain-of-Table with Chain-of-Thought and Dater, as representative generic and program-aided reasoning methods. We illustrate this using results from PaLM 2 on WikiTQ. Performance of Chain-of-Thought, Dater, and the proposed Chain-of-Table on WikiTQ for questions that require an operation chain of varying lengths. Our proposed atomic operations significantly improve performance over generic and program-aided reasoning counterparts. Notably, Chain-of-Table consistently surpasses both baseline methods across all operation chain lengths, with a significant margin up to 11.6% compared with Chain-of-Thought, and up to 7.9% compared with Dater. Moreover, the performance of Chain-of-Table declines gracefully with increasing number of operations compared to other baseline methods, exhibiting only a minimal decrease when the number of operations increases from four to five. Better robustness with larger tables We categorize the tables from WikiTQ into three groups based on token number: small (<2000 tokens), medium (2000 to 4000 tokens) and large (>4000 tokens). We then compare Chain-of-Table with Dater and Binder, the two latest and strongest baselines. Performance of Binder, Dater, and the proposed Chain-of-Table on small (<2000 tokens), medium (2000 to 4000 tokens), and large (>4000 tokens) tables from WikiTQ. We observe that the performance decreases with larger input tables while Chain-of-Table diminishes gracefully, achieving significant improvements over competing methods.

Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">large language models</a> (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding</a> (NLU) tasks by generating reliable reasoning chains, as shown in works like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">Chain-of-Thought</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625\">Least-to-Most</a>. However, the most suitable way for LLMs to reason over tabular data remains an open question.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04398\">Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding</a>\u201d, we propose a framework to tackle table understanding tasks, where we train LLMs to outline their reasoning step by step, updating a given table iteratively to reflect each part of a thought process, akin to how people solve the table-based problems. This enables the LLM to transform the table into simpler and more manageable segments so that it can understand and analyze each part of the table in depth. This approach has yielded significant improvements and achieved new state-of-the-art results on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305\">WikiTQ</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02164\">TabFact</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00369\">FeTaQA</a> benchmarks. The figure below shows the high-level overview of the proposed Chain-of-Table and other methods.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKT_df1rC8nK-ULOLPjtJ8gFaDHzRi7DX92Ix7OboQhOUNvqh_Melp9SVRWEsgL1Vu6IX9RuMgX7_UIuyeuHr7H0YwJdo6om2M2rX5d9wqOWsXWVAa9o0S75bIt7qG2DiGlhYypk0KKBMSxz2Z8vgmQqxTvy3bVrmH4nSC4Nzv8fZm6mOoA5yEXN_CgC4h/s1478/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKT_df1rC8nK-ULOLPjtJ8gFaDHzRi7DX92Ix7OboQhOUNvqh_Melp9SVRWEsgL1Vu6IX9RuMgX7_UIuyeuHr7H0YwJdo6om2M2rX5d9wqOWsXWVAa9o0S75bIt7qG2DiGlhYypk0KKBMSxz2Z8vgmQqxTvy3bVrmH4nSC4Nzv8fZm6mOoA5yEXN_CgC4h/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Given a complex table where a cyclist\u2019s nationality and name are in the same cell, (a) generic, multi-step reasoning is unable to provide the correct answer (b) program-aided reasoning generates and executes programs (e.g., SQL queries) to deliver the answer, but falls short in accurately addressing the question. In contrast, (c) Chain-of-Table iteratively samples a chain of operations that effectively transform the complex table into a version specifically tailored to the question.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br />\n\n<h2>Chain-of-Table</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nIn Chain-of-Table, we guide LLMs using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">in-context learning</a> to iteratively generate operations and to update the table to represent its reasoning chain over tabular data. This enables LLMs to dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, which provides a more structured and clear representation of the reasoning process for a given problem and enables more accurate and reliable predictions from the LLM. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, when asked, \u201cWhich actor has the most NAACP image awards?\u201d the Chain-of-Table framework prompts an LLM to generate tabular operations mirroring tabular reasoning processes. It first identifies the relevant columns. Then, it aggregates rows based on shared content. Finally, it reorders the aggregated results to yield a final table that clearly answers the posed question. \n</p>\n<p>\nThese operations transform the table to align with the question presented. To balance performance with computational expense on large tables, we construct the operation chain according to a subset of tabular rows.. Meanwhile, the step-by-step operations reveal the underlying reasoning process through the display of intermediate results from the tabular operations, fostering enhanced interpretability and understanding.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s1999/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of the tabular reasoning process in Chain-of-Table.

During this process, we create an operation chain acting as a proxy for the  tabular reasoning steps. These operations generate intermediate tables presenting the results of each step to the LLM. Consequently, the output table contains comprehensive information about the intermediate phases of tabular reasoning.

Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">large language models</a> (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding</a> (NLU) tasks by generating reliable reasoning chains, as shown in works like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">Chain-of-Thought</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625\">Least-to-Most</a>. However, the most suitable way for LLMs to reason over tabular data remains an open question.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04398\">Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding</a>\u201d, we propose a framework to tackle table understanding tasks, where we train LLMs to outline their reasoning step by step, updating a given table iteratively to reflect each part of a thought process, akin to how people solve the table-based problems. This enables the LLM to transform the table into simpler and more manageable segments so that it can understand and analyze each part of the table in depth. This approach has yielded significant improvements and achieved new state-of-the-art results on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305\">WikiTQ</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02164\">TabFact</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00369\">FeTaQA</a> benchmarks.

This enables LLMs to dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, which provides a more structured and clear representation of the reasoning process for a given problem and enables more accurate and reliable predictions from the LLM. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, when asked, \u201cWhich actor has the most NAACP image awards?\u201d the Chain-of-Table framework prompts an LLM to generate tabular operations mirroring tabular reasoning processes. It first identifies the relevant columns. Then, it aggregates rows based on shared content. Finally, it reorders the aggregated results to yield a final table that clearly answers the posed question. \n</p>\n<p>\nThese operations transform the table to align with the question presented. To balance performance with computational expense on large tables, we construct the operation chain according to a subset of tabular rows..

Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">large language models</a> (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding</a> (NLU) tasks by generating reliable reasoning chains, as shown in works like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">Chain-of-Thought</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625\">Least-to-Most</a>. However, the most suitable way for LLMs to reason over tabular data remains an open question.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04398\">Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding</a>\u201d, we propose a framework to tackle table understanding tasks, where we train LLMs to outline their reasoning step by step, updating a given table iteratively to reflect each part of a thought process, akin to how people solve the table-based problems. This enables the LLM to transform the table into simpler and more manageable segments so that it can understand and analyze each part of the table in depth. This approach has yielded significant improvements and achieved new state-of-the-art results on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305\">WikiTQ</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02164\">TabFact</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00369\">FeTaQA</a> benchmarks.

This enables LLMs to dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, which provides a more structured and clear representation of the reasoning process for a given problem and enables more accurate and reliable predictions from the LLM. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, when asked, \u201cWhich actor has the most NAACP image awards?\u201d the Chain-of-Table framework prompts an LLM to generate tabular operations mirroring tabular reasoning processes. It first identifies the relevant columns. Then, it aggregates rows based on shared content. Finally, it reorders the aggregated results to yield a final table that clearly answers the posed question. \n</p>\n<p>\nThese operations transform the table to align with the question presented. To balance performance with computational expense on large tables, we construct the operation chain according to a subset of tabular rows.. Meanwhile, the step-by-step operations reveal the underlying reasoning process through the display of intermediate results from the tabular operations, fostering enhanced interpretability and understanding.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s1999/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of the tabular reasoning process in Chain-of-Table.

Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">large language models</a> (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding\">natural language understanding</a> (NLU) tasks by generating reliable reasoning chains, as shown in works like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">Chain-of-Thought</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625\">Least-to-Most</a>. However, the most suitable way for LLMs to reason over tabular data remains an open question.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04398\">Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding</a>\u201d, we propose a framework to tackle table understanding tasks, where we train LLMs to outline their reasoning step by step, updating a given table iteratively to reflect each part of a thought process, akin to how people solve the table-based problems. This enables the LLM to transform the table into simpler and more manageable segments so that it can understand and analyze each part of the table in depth. This approach has yielded significant improvements and achieved new state-of-the-art results on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305\">WikiTQ</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02164\">TabFact</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00369\">FeTaQA</a> benchmarks.

In contrast, (c) Chain-of-Table iteratively samples a chain of operations that effectively transform the complex table into a version specifically tailored to the question.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br />\n\n<h2>Chain-of-Table</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nIn Chain-of-Table, we guide LLMs using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">in-context learning</a> to iteratively generate operations and to update the table to represent its reasoning chain over tabular data. This enables LLMs to dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, which provides a more structured and clear representation of the reasoning process for a given problem and enables more accurate and reliable predictions from the LLM. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, when asked, \u201cWhich actor has the most NAACP image awards?\u201d the Chain-of-Table framework prompts an LLM to generate tabular operations mirroring tabular reasoning processes. It first identifies the relevant columns. Then, it aggregates rows based on shared content. Finally, it reorders the aggregated results to yield a final table that clearly answers the posed question. \n</p>\n<p>\nThese operations transform the table to align with the question presented. To balance performance with computational expense on large tables, we construct the operation chain according to a subset of tabular rows.. Meanwhile, the step-by-step operations reveal the underlying reasoning process through the display of intermediate results from the tabular operations, fostering enhanced interpretability and understanding.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s1999/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8JwNNHW6SR1PSRTj79oQKqE1K48onxbcM9uwIlacEGnUqtua0jgkXQ-CfyUukJ0qiBhqsKl1_YfeJmcqkMEe5TR08eo9ZEqymWYszwNyKfZjcx0T-wYwEnHqCvdlf9lJAG8UTBN6RZQngH7sv0hQ9szR1wgjyiFSaOIqVHC08bJv6HeaXvWJMHH41wI4_/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of the tabular reasoning process in Chain-of-Table.

As above, Chain-of-Table considers three components in the prompt as shown in the figure: (1) the question, (2) the selected operation and its required arguments, and (3) the latest intermediate table.  \n</p>\n<p>\nFor instance, when the operation <code>f_group_by</code> is selected, it requires a header name as its argument. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe LLM selects a suitable header within the table. Equipped with the selected operation and the generated arguments, Chain-of-Table executes the operation and constructs a new intermediate table for the following reasoning.\n</p>\n<p>\nChain-of-Table iterates the previous two stages to plan the next operation and generate the required arguments. During this process, we create an operation chain acting as a proxy for the  tabular reasoning steps. These operations generate intermediate tables presenting the results of each step to the LLM. Consequently, the output table contains comprehensive information about the intermediate phases of tabular reasoning. In our final stage, we employ this output table in formulating the final query and prompt the LLM along with the question for the final answer.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental setup</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe use <a href=\"https://ai.google/discover/palm2/\">PaLM 2-S</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates\">GPT 3.5</a>&nbsp;as the backbone LLMs and conduct the experiments on three public table understanding benchmarks: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305\">WikiTQ</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02164\">TabFact</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00369\">FeTaQA</a>.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Dave Steiner, Clinical Research Scientist, Google Health, and Rory Pilgrim, Product Manager, Google Research There\u2019s a worldwide shortage of access to medical imaging expert interpretation across specialties including radiology, dermatology and pathology. Machine learning (ML) technology can help ease this burden by powering tools that enable doctors to interpret these images more accurately and efficiently. However, the development and implementation of such ML tools are often limited by the availability of high-quality data, ML expertise, and computational resources. One way to catalyze the use of ML for medical imaging is via domain-specific models that utilize deep learning (DL) to capture the information in medical images as compressed numerical vectors (called embeddings). These embeddings represent a type of pre-learned understanding of the important features in an image. Identifying patterns in the embeddings reduces the amount of data, expertise, and compute needed to train performant models as compared to working with high-dimensional data, such as images, directly. Indeed, these embeddings can be used to perform a variety of downstream tasks within the specialized domain (see animated graphic below). This framework of leveraging pre-learned understanding to solve related tasks is similar to that of a seasoned guitar player quickly learning a new song by ear. Because the guitar player has already built up a foundation of skill and understanding, they can quickly pick up the patterns and groove of a new song. Path Foundation is used to convert a small dataset of (image, label) pairs into (embedding, label) pairs. These pairs can then be used to train a task-specific classifier using a linear probe, (i.e., a lightweight linear classifier) as represented in this graphic, or other types of models using the embeddings as input. Once the linear probe is trained, it can be used to make predictions on embeddings from new images. These predictions can be compared to ground truth information in order to evaluate the linear probe's performance. In order to make this type of embedding model available and drive further development of ML tools in medical imaging, we are excited to release two domain-specific tools for research use: Derm Foundation and Path Foundation. This follows on the strong response we\u2019ve already received from researchers using the CXR Foundation embedding tool for chest radiographs and represents a portion of our expanding research offerings across multiple medical-specialized modalities. These embedding tools take an image as input and produce a numerical vector (the embedding) that is specialized to the domains of dermatology and digital pathology images, respectively. By running a dataset of chest X-ray, dermatology, or pathology images through the respective embedding tool, researchers can obtain embeddings for their own images, and use these embeddings to quickly develop new models for their applications. Path Foundation In \u201cDomain-specific optimization and diverse evaluation of self-supervised models for histopathology\u201d, we showed that self-supervised learning (SSL) models for pathology images outperform traditional pre-training approaches and enable efficient training of classifiers for downstream tasks. This effort focused on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides, the principal tissue stain in diagnostic pathology that enables pathologists to visualize cellular features under a microscope. The performance of linear classifiers trained using the output of the SSL models matched that of prior DL models trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data. Due to substantial differences between digital pathology images and \u201cnatural image\u201d photos, this work involved several pathology-specific optimizations during model training. One key element is that whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can be 100,000 pixels across (thousands of times larger than typical smartphone photos) and are analyzed by experts at multiple magnifications (zoom levels). As such, the WSIs are typically broken down into smaller tiles or patches for computer vision and DL applications. The resulting images are information dense with cells or tissue structures distributed throughout the frame instead of having distinct semantic objects or foreground vs. background variations, thus creating unique challenges for robust SSL and feature extraction. Additionally, physical (e.g., cutting) and chemical (e.g., fixing and staining) processes used to prepare the samples can influence image appearance dramatically. Taking these important aspects into consideration, pathology-specific SSL optimizations included helping the model learn stain-agnostic features, generalizing the model to patches from multiple magnifications, augmenting the data to mimic scanning and image post processing, and custom data balancing to improve input heterogeneity for SSL training. These approaches were extensively evaluated using a broad set of benchmark tasks involving 17 different tissue types over 12 different tasks. Utilizing the vision transformer (ViT-S/16) architecture, Path Foundation was selected as the best performing model from the optimization and evaluation process described above (and illustrated in the figure below). This model thus provides an important balance between performance and model size to enable valuable and scalable use in generating embeddings over the many individual image patches of large pathology WSIs. SSL training with pathology-specific optimizations for Path Foundation. The value of domain-specific image representations can also be seen in the figure below, which shows the linear probing performance improvement of Path Foundation (as measured by AUROC) compared to traditional pre-training on natural images (ImageNet-21k). This includes evaluation for tasks such as metastatic breast cancer detection in lymph nodes, prostate cancer grading, and breast cancer grading, among others. Path Foundation embeddings significantly outperform traditional ImageNet embeddings as evaluated by linear probing across multiple evaluation tasks in histopathology. Derm Foundation Derm Foundation is an embedding tool derived from our research in applying DL to interpret images of dermatology conditions and includes our recent work that adds improvements to generalize better to new datasets. Due to its dermatology-specific pre-training it has a latent understanding of features present in images of skin conditions and can be used to quickly develop models to classify skin conditions. The model underlying the API is a BiT ResNet-101x3 trained in two stages. The first pre-training stage uses contrastive learning, similar to ConVIRT, to train on a large number of image-text pairs from the internet. In the second stage, the image component of this pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for condition classification using clinical datasets, such as those from teledermatology services. Unlike histopathology images, dermatology images more closely resemble the real-world images used to train many of today's computer vision models. However, for specialized dermatology tasks, creating a high-quality model may still require a large dataset. With Derm Foundation, researchers can use their own smaller dataset to retrieve domain-specific embeddings, and use those to build smaller models (e.g., linear classifiers or other small non-linear models) that enable them to validate their research or product ideas. To evaluate this approach, we trained models on a downstream task using teledermatology data. Model training involved varying dataset sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to compare embedding-based linear classifiers against fine-tuning. The modeling variants considered were: A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from BiT-M (a standard pre-trained image model) Fine-tuned version of BiT-M with an extra dense layer for the downstream task A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from the Derm Foundation API Fine-tuned version of the model underlying the Derm Foundation API with an extra layer for the downstream task We found that models built on top of the Derm Foundation embeddings for dermatology-related tasks achieved significantly higher quality than those built solely on embeddings or fine tuned from BiT-M. This advantage was found to be most pronounced for smaller training dataset sizes. These results demonstrate that the Derm Foundation tooI can serve as a useful starting point to accelerate skin-related modeling tasks. We aim to enable other researchers to build on the underlying features and representations of dermatology that the model has learned. However, there are limitations with this analysis. We're still exploring how well these embeddings generalize across task types, patient populations, and image settings. Downstream models built using Derm Foundation still require careful evaluation to understand their expected performance in the intended setting. Access Path and Derm Foundation We envision that the Derm Foundation and Path Foundation embedding tools will enable a range of use cases, including efficient development of models for diagnostic tasks, quality assurance and pre-analytical workflow improvements, image indexing and curation, and biomarker discovery and validation. We are releasing both tools to the research community so they can explore the utility of the embeddings for their own dermatology and pathology data. To get access, please sign up to each tool's terms of service using the following Google Forms. Derm Foundation Access Form Path Foundation Access Form After gaining access to each tool, you can use the API to retrieve embeddings from dermatology images or digital pathology images stored in Google Cloud. Approved users who are just curious to see the model and embeddings in action can use the provided example Colab notebooks to train models using public data for classifying six common skin conditions or identifying tumors in histopathology patches. We look forward to seeing the range of use-cases these tools can unlock.

This follows on the strong response we\u2019ve already received from researchers using the <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2022/07/simplified-transfer-learning-for-chest.html\">CXR Foundation</a> embedding tool for chest radiographs and represents a portion of our expanding research offerings across multiple medical-specialized modalities. These embedding tools take an image as input and produce a numerical vector (the embedding) that is specialized to the domains of dermatology and digital pathology images, respectively. By running a dataset of chest X-ray, dermatology, or pathology images through the respective embedding tool, researchers can obtain embeddings for their own images, and use these embeddings to quickly develop new models for their applications.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Path Foundation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13259\">Domain-specific optimization and diverse evaluation of self-supervised models for histopathology</a>\u201d, we showed that self-supervised learning (SSL) models for pathology images outperform traditional pre-training approaches and enable efficient training of classifiers for downstream tasks. This effort focused on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26E_stain\">hematoxylin and eosin</a> (H&amp;E) stained slides, the principal tissue stain in diagnostic pathology that enables pathologists to visualize cellular features under a microscope. The performance of linear classifiers trained using the output of the SSL models matched that of prior DL models trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nDue to substantial differences between digital pathology images and \u201cnatural image\u201d photos, this work involved several pathology-specific optimizations during model training. One key element is that  <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522141/\">whole-slide images</a> (WSIs) in pathology can be 100,000 pixels across (thousands of times larger than typical smartphone photos) and are analyzed by experts at multiple magnifications (zoom levels). As such, the WSIs are typically broken down into smaller tiles or patches for computer vision and DL applications. The resulting images are information dense with cells or tissue structures distributed throughout the frame instead of having  distinct semantic objects or foreground vs. background variations, thus creating unique challenges for robust SSL and feature extraction. Additionally, physical (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome\">cutting</a>) and chemical (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)\">fixing</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining\">staining</a>) processes used to prepare the samples can influence image appearance dramatically. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nTaking these important aspects into consideration, pathology-specific SSL optimizations included helping the model learn <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12694\">stain-agnostic features</a>, generalizing the model to patches from multiple magnifications, <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2020/02/generating-diverse-synthetic-medical.html\">augmenting</a> the data to mimic scanning and image post processing, and custom data balancing to improve input heterogeneity for SSL training. These approaches were extensively evaluated using a broad set of benchmark tasks involving 17 different tissue types over 12 different tasks. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nUtilizing the vision transformer (<a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer\">ViT-S/16</a>) architecture, Path Foundation was selected as the best performing model from the optimization and evaluation process described above (and illustrated in the figure below). This model thus provides an important balance between performance and model size to enable valuable and scalable use in generating embeddings over the many individual image patches of large pathology WSIs.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG4jlO0GRCgYA3fe6CteF9PYvm3joBGIBPXakdWWaQ7ztTTBK36dmrtRpK1xoNVub8MTMvmCzkW0wfCCkYUH3fnvKk8hJb79o4vETQq0MhqS1JDBxWgYUwFkjtpnkgx5jBiDOxwovsfgqvpNzVGpz6CY6nTJzJgSgtuE2qDRzIb9O7fbHrhdNU1-IWPSXp/s1999/Path%20+%20Derm%20SSL.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG4jlO0GRCgYA3fe6CteF9PYvm3joBGIBPXakdWWaQ7ztTTBK36dmrtRpK1xoNVub8MTMvmCzkW0wfCCkYUH3fnvKk8hJb79o4vETQq0MhqS1JDBxWgYUwFkjtpnkgx5jBiDOxwovsfgqvpNzVGpz6CY6nTJzJgSgtuE2qDRzIb9O7fbHrhdNU1-IWPSXp/s16000/Path%20+%20Derm%20SSL.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">SSL training with pathology-specific optimizations for Path Foundation.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<p>\nThe value of domain-specific image representations can also be seen in the figure below, which shows the linear probing performance improvement of Path Foundation (as measured by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic\">AUROC</a>) compared to traditional pre-training on natural images (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10972\">ImageNet-21k</a>).

Due to its dermatology-specific pre-training it has a latent understanding of features present in images of skin conditions and can be used to quickly develop models to classify skin conditions. The model underlying the API is a <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT ResNet-101x3</a> trained in two stages. The first pre-training stage uses contrastive learning, similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747\">ConVIRT</a>, to train on a large number of image-text pairs <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html\">from the internet</a>. In the second stage, the image component of this pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for condition classification using clinical datasets, such as those from teledermatology services.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnlike histopathology images, dermatology images more closely resemble the real-world images used to train many of today's computer vision models. However, for specialized dermatology tasks, creating a high-quality model may still require a large dataset. With Derm Foundation, researchers can use their own smaller dataset to retrieve domain-specific embeddings, and use those to build smaller models (e.g., linear classifiers or other small non-linear models) that enable them to validate their research or product ideas. To evaluate this approach, we trained models on a downstream task using teledermatology data. Model training involved varying dataset sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to compare embedding-based linear classifiers against fine-tuning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe modeling variants considered were:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT-M</a> (a standard pre-trained image model)\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of BiT-M with an extra dense layer for the downstream task\n\n</li><li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from the Derm Foundation API\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of the model underlying the Derm Foundation API with an extra layer for the downstream task\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe found that models built on top of the Derm Foundation embeddings for dermatology-related tasks achieved significantly higher quality than those built solely on embeddings or fine tuned from BiT-M.

Due to its dermatology-specific pre-training it has a latent understanding of features present in images of skin conditions and can be used to quickly develop models to classify skin conditions. The model underlying the API is a <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT ResNet-101x3</a> trained in two stages. The first pre-training stage uses contrastive learning, similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747\">ConVIRT</a>, to train on a large number of image-text pairs <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html\">from the internet</a>. In the second stage, the image component of this pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for condition classification using clinical datasets, such as those from teledermatology services.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnlike histopathology images, dermatology images more closely resemble the real-world images used to train many of today's computer vision models. However, for specialized dermatology tasks, creating a high-quality model may still require a large dataset. With Derm Foundation, researchers can use their own smaller dataset to retrieve domain-specific embeddings, and use those to build smaller models (e.g., linear classifiers or other small non-linear models) that enable them to validate their research or product ideas. To evaluate this approach, we trained models on a downstream task using teledermatology data. Model training involved varying dataset sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to compare embedding-based linear classifiers against fine-tuning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe modeling variants considered were:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT-M</a> (a standard pre-trained image model)\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of BiT-M with an extra dense layer for the downstream task\n\n</li><li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from the Derm Foundation API\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of the model underlying the Derm Foundation API with an extra layer for the downstream task\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe found that models built on top of the Derm Foundation embeddings for dermatology-related tasks achieved significantly higher quality than those built solely on embeddings or fine tuned from BiT-M.

Machine learning (ML) technology can help ease this burden by powering tools that enable doctors to interpret these images more accurately and efficiently. However, the development and implementation of such ML tools are often limited by the availability of high-quality data, ML expertise, and computational resources. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nOne way to catalyze the use of ML for medical imaging is via domain-specific models that utilize deep learning (DL) to capture the information in medical images as compressed numerical vectors (called embeddings). These embeddings represent a type of pre-learned understanding of the important features in an image. Identifying patterns in the embeddings reduces the amount of data, expertise, and compute needed to train performant models as compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality\">working with high-dimensional data</a>, such as images, directly. Indeed, these embeddings can be used to perform a variety of downstream tasks within the specialized domain (see animated graphic below).

Due to its dermatology-specific pre-training it has a latent understanding of features present in images of skin conditions and can be used to quickly develop models to classify skin conditions. The model underlying the API is a <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT ResNet-101x3</a> trained in two stages. The first pre-training stage uses contrastive learning, similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747\">ConVIRT</a>, to train on a large number of image-text pairs <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html\">from the internet</a>. In the second stage, the image component of this pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for condition classification using clinical datasets, such as those from teledermatology services.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnlike histopathology images, dermatology images more closely resemble the real-world images used to train many of today's computer vision models. However, for specialized dermatology tasks, creating a high-quality model may still require a large dataset. With Derm Foundation, researchers can use their own smaller dataset to retrieve domain-specific embeddings, and use those to build smaller models (e.g., linear classifiers or other small non-linear models) that enable them to validate their research or product ideas. To evaluate this approach, we trained models on a downstream task using teledermatology data. Model training involved varying dataset sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to compare embedding-based linear classifiers against fine-tuning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe modeling variants considered were:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT-M</a> (a standard pre-trained image model)\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of BiT-M with an extra dense layer for the downstream task\n\n</li><li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from the Derm Foundation API\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of the model underlying the Derm Foundation API with an extra layer for the downstream task\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe found that models built on top of the Derm Foundation embeddings for dermatology-related tasks achieved significantly higher quality than those built solely on embeddings or fine tuned from BiT-M.

Machine learning (ML) technology can help ease this burden by powering tools that enable doctors to interpret these images more accurately and efficiently. However, the development and implementation of such ML tools are often limited by the availability of high-quality data, ML expertise, and computational resources. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nOne way to catalyze the use of ML for medical imaging is via domain-specific models that utilize deep learning (DL) to capture the information in medical images as compressed numerical vectors (called embeddings). These embeddings represent a type of pre-learned understanding of the important features in an image. Identifying patterns in the embeddings reduces the amount of data, expertise, and compute needed to train performant models as compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality\">working with high-dimensional data</a>, such as images, directly. Indeed, these embeddings can be used to perform a variety of downstream tasks within the specialized domain (see animated graphic below). This framework of leveraging pre-learned understanding to solve related tasks is similar to that of a seasoned guitar player quickly learning a new song by ear. Because the guitar player has already built up a foundation of skill and understanding, they can quickly pick up the patterns and groove of a new song. \n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglGgLglQSBBcJqiT_SsxQf9AKGyrenZw28xTiqVP9qljNyD8mhpv-m4kl27u4NLm0FGJShNOuK456JIzdQ269xBx3fBi1u2ke10iE4THphEkD9MCCGrHjhrddtAHJ27g3pyznABW3i_CxTNkONPsH-BOcoFgS4A8tscJsJ42eD5XAHJ3FVzkfmltMzUKkq/s1600/Path%20+%20Derm%20train%20LP.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglGgLglQSBBcJqiT_SsxQf9AKGyrenZw28xTiqVP9qljNyD8mhpv-m4kl27u4NLm0FGJShNOuK456JIzdQ269xBx3fBi1u2ke10iE4THphEkD9MCCGrHjhrddtAHJ27g3pyznABW3i_CxTNkONPsH-BOcoFgS4A8tscJsJ42eD5XAHJ3FVzkfmltMzUKkq/s16000/Path%20+%20Derm%20train%20LP.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Path Foundation is used to convert a small dataset of (image, label) pairs into (embedding, label) pairs.

This effort focused on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26E_stain\">hematoxylin and eosin</a> (H&amp;E) stained slides, the principal tissue stain in diagnostic pathology that enables pathologists to visualize cellular features under a microscope. The performance of linear classifiers trained using the output of the SSL models matched that of prior DL models trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nDue to substantial differences between digital pathology images and \u201cnatural image\u201d photos, this work involved several pathology-specific optimizations during model training. One key element is that  <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522141/\">whole-slide images</a> (WSIs) in pathology can be 100,000 pixels across (thousands of times larger than typical smartphone photos) and are analyzed by experts at multiple magnifications (zoom levels). As such, the WSIs are typically broken down into smaller tiles or patches for computer vision and DL applications. The resulting images are information dense with cells or tissue structures distributed throughout the frame instead of having  distinct semantic objects or foreground vs. background variations, thus creating unique challenges for robust SSL and feature extraction. Additionally, physical (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome\">cutting</a>) and chemical (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)\">fixing</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining\">staining</a>) processes used to prepare the samples can influence image appearance dramatically. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nTaking these important aspects into consideration, pathology-specific SSL optimizations included helping the model learn <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12694\">stain-agnostic features</a>, generalizing the model to patches from multiple magnifications, <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2020/02/generating-diverse-synthetic-medical.html\">augmenting</a> the data to mimic scanning and image post processing, and custom data balancing to improve input heterogeneity for SSL training.

The first pre-training stage uses contrastive learning, similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747\">ConVIRT</a>, to train on a large number of image-text pairs <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html\">from the internet</a>. In the second stage, the image component of this pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for condition classification using clinical datasets, such as those from teledermatology services.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnlike histopathology images, dermatology images more closely resemble the real-world images used to train many of today's computer vision models. However, for specialized dermatology tasks, creating a high-quality model may still require a large dataset. With Derm Foundation, researchers can use their own smaller dataset to retrieve domain-specific embeddings, and use those to build smaller models (e.g., linear classifiers or other small non-linear models) that enable them to validate their research or product ideas. To evaluate this approach, we trained models on a downstream task using teledermatology data. Model training involved varying dataset sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to compare embedding-based linear classifiers against fine-tuning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe modeling variants considered were:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer\">BiT-M</a> (a standard pre-trained image model)\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of BiT-M with an extra dense layer for the downstream task\n\n</li><li>A linear classifier on frozen embeddings from the Derm Foundation API\n\n</li><li>Fine-tuned version of the model underlying the Derm Foundation API with an extra layer for the downstream task\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe found that models built on top of the Derm Foundation embeddings for dermatology-related tasks achieved significantly higher quality than those built solely on embeddings or fine tuned from BiT-M. This advantage was found to be most pronounced for smaller training dataset sizes.\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3cFSDBqVdsZm4MaFhMXli6kEJazYEB4xEYPB6ebOPv24HPd57Puw1zfu85raJ0gqfpnwsLW99Wh6aShuoCKZNYLw1PiG7eIqUEm8nMvwTy2qQTNL8ptn7cqBll127x_iEIsDMjznY5pWRIYF89cvBP3uPiVfMTgJS8aQpXiOC3oCO1Xl8CxTc4LXrLnjY/s1240/Path%20+%20Derm%20task%20accuracy.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3cFSDBqVdsZm4MaFhMXli6kEJazYEB4xEYPB6ebOPv24HPd57Puw1zfu85raJ0gqfpnwsLW99Wh6aShuoCKZNYLw1PiG7eIqUEm8nMvwTy2qQTNL8ptn7cqBll127x_iEIsDMjznY5pWRIYF89cvBP3uPiVfMTgJS8aQpXiOC3oCO1Xl8CxTc4LXrLnjY/s16000/Path%20+%20Derm%20task%20accuracy.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">These results demonstrate that the Derm Foundation tooI can serve as a useful starting point to accelerate skin-related modeling tasks.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Research Intern, and Florian Hartmann, Software Engineer, Google Research Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the state of the art for solving tasks specified using natural language, often reaching performance close to that of people. As these models increasingly enable assistive agents, it could be beneficial for them to learn effectively from each other, much like people do in social settings, which would allow LLM-based agents to improve each other\u2019s performance. To discuss the learning processes of humans, Bandura and Walters described the concept of social learning in 1977, outlining different models of observational learning used by people. One common method of learning from others is through a verbal instruction (e.g., from a teacher) that describes how to engage in a particular behavior. Alternatively, learning can happen through a live model by mimicking a live example of the behavior. Given the success of LLMs mimicking human communication, in our paper \u201cSocial Learning: Towards Collaborative Learning with Large Language Models\u201d, we investigate whether LLMs are able to learn from each other using social learning. To this end, we outline a framework for social learning in which LLMs share knowledge with each other in a privacy-aware manner using natural language. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on various datasets, and propose quantitative methods that measure privacy in this setting. In contrast to previous approaches to collaborative learning, such as common federated learning approaches that often rely on gradients, in our framework, agents teach each other purely using natural language. Social learning for LLMs To extend social learning to language models, we consider the scenario where a student LLM should learn to solve a task from multiple teacher entities that already know that task. In our paper, we evaluate the student\u2019s performance on a variety of tasks, such as spam detection in short text messages (SMS), solving grade school math problems, and answering questions based on a given text. A visualization of the social learning process: A teacher model provides instructions or few-shot examples to a student model without sharing its private data. Language models have shown a remarkable capacity to perform tasks given only a handful of examples\u2013a process called few-shot learning. With this in mind, we provide human-labeled examples of a task that enables the teacher model to teach it to a student. One of the main use cases of social learning arises when these examples cannot be directly shared with the student due, for example, to privacy concerns. To illustrate this, let\u2019s look at a hypothetical example for a spam detection task. A teacher model is located on device where some users volunteer to mark incoming messages they receive as either \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cnot spam\u201d. This is useful data that could help train a student model to differentiate between spam and not spam, but sharing personal messages with other users is a breach of privacy and should be avoided. To prevent this, a social learning process can transfer the knowledge from the teacher model to the student so it learns what spam messages look like without needing to share the user\u2019s personal text messages. We investigate the effectiveness of this social learning approach by analogy with the established human social learning theory that we discussed above. In these experiments, we use PaLM 2-S models for both the teacher and the student. A systems view of social learning: At training time, multiple teachers teach the student. At inference time, the student is using what it learned from the teachers. Synthetic examples As a counterpart to the live teaching model described for traditional social learning, we propose a learning method where the teachers generate new synthetic examples for the task and share them with the student. This is motivated by the idea that one can create a new example that is sufficiently different from the original one, but is just as educational. Indeed, we observe that our generated examples are sufficiently different from the real ones to preserve privacy while still enabling performance comparable to that achieved using the original examples. The 8 generated examples perform as well as the original data for several tasks (see our paper). We evaluate the efficacy of learning through synthetic examples on our task suite. Especially when the number of examples is high enough, e.g., n = 16, we observe no statistically significant difference between sharing original data and teaching with synthesized data via social learning for the majority of tasks, indicating that the privacy improvement does not have to come at the cost of model quality. Generating 16 instead of just 8 examples further reduces the performance gap relative to the original examples. The one exception is spam detection, for which teaching with synthesized data yields lower accuracy. This may be because the training procedure of current models makes them biased to only generate non-spam examples. In the paper, we additionally look into aggregation methods for selecting good subsets of examples to use. Synthetic instruction Given the success of language models in following instructions, the verbal instruction model can also be naturally adapted to language models by having the teachers generate an instruction for the task. Our experiments show that providing such a generated instruction effectively improves performance over zero-shot prompting, reaching accuracies comparable to few-shot prompting with original examples. However, we did find that the teacher model may fail on certain tasks to provide a good instruction, for example due to a complicated formatting requirement of the output. For Lambada, GSM8k, and Random Insertion, providing synthetic examples performs better than providing generated instructions, whereas in the other tasks generated instruction obtains a higher accuracy. This observation suggests that the choice of the teaching model depends on the task at hand, similar to how the most effective method for teaching people varies by task. Depending on the task, generating instructions can work better than generating new examples. Memorization of the private examples We want teachers in social learning to teach the student without revealing specifics from the original data. To quantify how prone this process is to leaking information, we used Secret Sharer, a popular method for quantifying to what extent a model memorizes its training data, and adapted it to the social learning setting. We picked this method since it had previously been used for evaluating memorization in federated learning. To apply the Secret Sharer method to social learning, we design \u201ccanary\u201d data points such that we can concretely measure how much the training process memorized them. These data points are included in the datasets used by teachers to generate new examples. After the social learning process completes, we can then measure how much more confident the student is in the secret data points the teacher used, compared to similar ones that were not shared even with the teachers. In our analysis, discussed in detail in the paper, we use canary examples that include names and codes. Our results show that the student is only slightly more confident in the canaries the teacher used. In contrast, when the original data points are directly shared with the student, the confidence in the included canaries is much higher than in the held-out set. This supports the conclusion that the teacher does indeed use its data to teach without simply copying it over. Conclusion and next steps We introduced a framework for social learning that allows language models with access to private data to transfer knowledge through textual communication while maintaining the privacy of that data. In this framework, we identified sharing examples and sharing instructions as basic models and evaluated them on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we adapted the Secret Sharer metric to our framework, proposing a metric for measuring data leakage. As next steps, we are looking for ways of improving the teaching process, for example by adding feedback loops and iteration. Furthermore, we want to investigate using social learning for modalities other than text.

As these models increasingly enable assistive agents, it could be beneficial for them to learn effectively from each other, much like people do in social settings, which would allow LLM-based agents to improve each other\u2019s performance. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a> \n\n<p>\nTo discuss the learning processes of humans, Bandura and Walters <a href=\"https://books.google.ch/books/about/Social_Learning_Theory.html?id=IXvuAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">described</a> the concept of <em>social learning</em> in 1977, outlining different models of observational learning used by people. One common method of learning from others is through a <em>verbal instruction</em> (e.g., from a teacher) that describes how to engage in a particular behavior. Alternatively, learning can happen through a <em>live model</em> by mimicking a live example of the behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven the success of LLMs mimicking human communication, in our paper \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11441\">Social Learning: Towards Collaborative Learning with Large Language Models</a>\u201d, we investigate whether LLMs are able to learn from each other using social learning. To this end, we outline a framework for social learning in which LLMs share knowledge with each other in a privacy-aware manner using natural language. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on various datasets, and propose quantitative methods that measure privacy in this setting. In contrast to previous approaches to collaborative learning, such as common <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html\">federated learning</a> approaches that often rely on gradients, in our framework, agents teach each other purely using natural language.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Social learning for LLMs</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nTo extend social learning to language models, we consider the scenario where a student LLM should learn to solve a task from multiple teacher entities that already know that task. In our paper, we evaluate the student\u2019s performance on a variety of tasks, such as <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2034691.2034742\">spam detection</a> in short text messages (SMS), solving <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168\">grade school math problems</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10044\">answering questions</a> based on a given text.   \n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAndq_MjAVBs4j3lmxEX71nMrCLpAasklndZyE8F7yj3slyafRsNauzW4yRxI_Ncg7Sp5jllAXpItsjA-BOmdB2O1jP3Awu09-DVRHBE_Urf58yzm5tDBBpM-aibZxmgA9O6CySCCRdSMMqG7vj-OU07jHa0OU0YixCxRB0Q3APMQbn8Vz5rEBp70ZNogH/s900/image3.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAndq_MjAVBs4j3lmxEX71nMrCLpAasklndZyE8F7yj3slyafRsNauzW4yRxI_Ncg7Sp5jllAXpItsjA-BOmdB2O1jP3Awu09-DVRHBE_Urf58yzm5tDBBpM-aibZxmgA9O6CySCCRdSMMqG7vj-OU07jHa0OU0YixCxRB0Q3APMQbn8Vz5rEBp70ZNogH/s16000/image3.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A visualization of the social learning process: A teacher model provides instructions or few-shot examples to a student model without sharing its private data.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>\nLanguage models have shown a remarkable capacity to perform tasks given only a handful of examples\u2013a process called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">few-shot learning</a>. With this in mind, we provide human-labeled examples of a task that enables the teacher model to teach it to a student. One of the main use cases of social learning arises when these examples cannot be directly shared with the student due, for example, to privacy concerns. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s look at a hypothetical example for a spam detection task. A teacher model is located on device where some users volunteer to mark incoming messages they receive as either \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cnot spam\u201d. This is useful data that could help train a student model to differentiate between spam and not spam, but sharing personal messages with other users is a breach of privacy and should be avoided. To prevent this, a social learning process can transfer the knowledge from the teacher model to the student so it learns what spam messages look like without needing to share the user\u2019s personal text messages.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe investigate the effectiveness of this social learning approach by analogy with the established human social learning theory that we discussed above. In these experiments, we use <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/\">PaLM 2-S</a> models for both the teacher and the student.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicN2GYOp9oUj5x0F20i550WuF5KmpD8iRqrdHmJFU_HmkdFY3RBF4mfn_99q8jtEPVm56a4NfjMGFJ79y3rygqjX46h23tlzSDde7iEbp8ytHsPa5-IsNKFFituSoPmtGk666gjyypTvVhhuin8FahZfhWPyDWqF5yWBIQ-Cf_DxQ7vrmTWIkA_tAJtm4v/s1999/image2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicN2GYOp9oUj5x0F20i550WuF5KmpD8iRqrdHmJFU_HmkdFY3RBF4mfn_99q8jtEPVm56a4NfjMGFJ79y3rygqjX46h23tlzSDde7iEbp8ytHsPa5-IsNKFFituSoPmtGk666gjyypTvVhhuin8FahZfhWPyDWqF5yWBIQ-Cf_DxQ7vrmTWIkA_tAJtm4v/s16000/image2.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A systems view of social learning: At training time, multiple teachers teach the student.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Omar Benjelloun, Software Engineer, Google Research, and Peter Mattson, Software Engineer, Google Core ML and President, MLCommons Association Machine learning (ML) practitioners looking to reuse existing datasets to train an ML model often spend a lot of time understanding the data, making sense of its organization, or figuring out what subset to use as features. So much time, in fact, that progress in the field of ML is hampered by a fundamental obstacle: the wide variety of data representations. ML datasets cover a broad range of content types, from text and structured data to images, audio, and video. Even within datasets that cover the same types of content, every dataset has a unique ad hoc arrangement of files and data formats. This challenge reduces productivity throughout the entire ML development process, from finding the data to training the model. It also impedes development of badly needed tooling for working with datasets. There are general purpose metadata formats for datasets such as schema.org and DCAT. However, these formats were designed for data discovery rather than for the specific needs of ML data, such as the ability to extract and combine data from structured and unstructured sources, to include metadata that would enable responsible use of the data, or to describe ML usage characteristics such as defining training, test and validation sets. Today, we're introducing Croissant, a new metadata format for ML-ready datasets. Croissant was developed collaboratively by a community from industry and academia, as part of the MLCommons effort. The Croissant format doesn't change how the actual data is represented (e.g., image or text file formats) \u2014 it provides a standard way to describe and organize it. Croissant builds upon schema.org, the de facto standard for publishing structured data on the Web, which is already used by over 40M datasets. Croissant augments it with comprehensive layers for ML relevant metadata, data resources, data organization, and default ML semantics. In addition, we are announcing support from major tools and repositories: Today, three widely used collections of ML datasets \u2014 Kaggle, Hugging Face, and OpenML \u2014 will begin supporting the Croissant format for the datasets they host; the Dataset Search tool lets users search for Croissant datasets across the Web; and popular ML frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, can load Croissant datasets easily using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) package. Croissant This 1.0 release of Croissant includes a complete specification of the format, a set of example datasets, an open source Python library to validate, consume and generate Croissant metadata, and an open source visual editor to load, inspect and create Croissant dataset descriptions in an intuitive way. Supporting Responsible AI (RAI) was a key goal of the Croissant effort from the start. We are also releasing the first version of the Croissant RAI vocabulary extension, which augments Croissant with key properties needed to describe important RAI use cases such as data life cycle management, data labeling, participatory data, ML safety and fairness evaluation, explainability, and compliance. Why a shared format for ML data? The majority of ML work is actually data work. The training data is the \u201ccode\u201d that determines the behavior of a model. Datasets can vary from a collection of text used to train a large language model (LLM) to a collection of driving scenarios (annotated videos) used to train a car\u2019s collision avoidance system. However, the steps to develop an ML model typically follow the same iterative data-centric process: (1) find or collect data, (2) clean and refine the data, (3) train the model on the data, (4) test the model on more data, (5) discover the model does not work, (6) analyze the data to find out why, (7) repeat until a workable model is achieved. Many steps are made harder by the lack of a common format. This \u201cdata development burden\u201d is especially heavy for resource-limited research and early-stage entrepreneurial efforts. The goal of a format like Croissant is to make this entire process easier. For instance, the metadata can be leveraged by search engines and dataset repositories to make it easier to find the right dataset. The data resources and organization information make it easier to develop tools for cleaning, refining, and analyzing data. This information and the default ML semantics make it possible for ML frameworks to use the data to train and test models with a minimum of code. Together, these improvements substantially reduce the data development burden. Additionally, dataset authors care about the discoverability and ease of use of their datasets. Adopting Croissant improves the value of their datasets, while only requiring a minimal effort, thanks to the available creation tools and support from ML data platforms. What can Croissant do today? The Croissant ecosystem: Users can Search for Croissant datasets, download them from major repositories, and easily load them into their favorite ML frameworks. They can create, inspect and modify Croissant metadata using the Croissant editor. Today, users can find Croissant datasets at: Google Dataset Search, which offers a Croissant filter. HuggingFace Kaggle OpenML With a Croissant dataset, it is possible to: Ingest data easily via TensorFlow Datasets for use in popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Inspect and modify the metadata using the Croissant editor UI (github). To publish a Croissant dataset, users can: Use the Croissant editor UI (github) to generate a large portion of Croissant metadata automatically by analyzing the data the user provides, and to fill important metadata fields such as RAI properties. Publish the Croissant information as part of their dataset Web page to make it discoverable and reusable. Publish their data in one of the repositories that support Croissant, such as Kaggle, HuggingFace and OpenML, and automatically generate Croissant metadata. Future direction We are excited about Croissant's potential to help ML practitioners, but making this format truly useful requires the support of the community. We encourage dataset creators to consider providing Croissant metadata. We encourage platforms hosting datasets to provide Croissant files for download and embed Croissant metadata in dataset Web pages so that they can be made discoverable by dataset search engines. Tools that help users work with ML datasets, such as labeling or data analysis tools should also consider supporting Croissant datasets. Together, we can reduce the data development burden and enable a richer ecosystem of ML research and development. We encourage the community to join us in contributing to the effort.

Croissant was developed collaboratively by a community from industry and academia, as part of the <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/\">MLCommons</a> effort. The Croissant format doesn't change how the actual data is represented (e.g., image or text file formats) \u2014 it provides a standard way to describe and organize it. Croissant builds upon <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">schema.org</a>, the de facto standard for publishing structured data on the Web, which is already used by over 40M datasets. Croissant augments it with comprehensive layers for ML relevant metadata, data resources, data organization, and default ML semantics.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, we are announcing support from major tools and repositories: Today, three widely used collections of ML datasets \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/datasets\">Kaggle</a>, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=croissant&amp;sort=trending\">Hugging Face</a>, and <a href=\"https://openml.org/search?type=data\">OpenML</a> \u2014 will begin supporting the Croissant format for the datasets they host; the <a href=\"http://g.co/datasetsearch\">Dataset Search</a> tool lets users search for Croissant datasets across the Web; and popular ML frameworks, including <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">TensorFlow</a>, <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\">PyTorch</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/google/jax\">JAX</a>, can load Croissant datasets easily using the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets\">TensorFlow Datasets</a> (TFDS) package.\n</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Croissant</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThis 1.0 release of Croissant includes a complete <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/croissant/1.0\">specification</a> of the format, a set of <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/datasets\">example datasets</a>, an open source <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/python/mlcroissant\">Python library</a> to validate, consume and generate Croissant metadata, and an open source <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/editor\">visual editor</a> to load, inspect and create Croissant dataset descriptions in an intuitive way.\n</p>\n<p>\nSupporting Responsible AI (RAI) was a key goal of the Croissant effort from the start. We are also releasing the first version of the <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/croissant/RAI/1.0\">Croissant RAI vocabulary</a> extension, which augments Croissant with key properties needed to describe important RAI use cases such as data life cycle management, data labeling, participatory data, ML safety and fairness evaluation, explainability, and compliance.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Why a shared format for ML data?</h2>\n<p>\nThe majority of ML work is actually data work. The training data is the \u201ccode\u201d that determines the behavior of a model. Datasets can vary from a collection of text used to train a large language model (LLM) to a collection of driving scenarios (annotated videos) used to train a car\u2019s collision avoidance system. However, the steps to develop an ML model typically follow the same iterative data-centric process: (1) find or collect data, (2) clean and refine the data, (3) train the model on the data, (4) test the model on more data, (5) discover the model does not work, (6) analyze the data to find out why, (7) repeat until a workable model is achieved. Many steps are made harder by the lack of a common format. This \u201cdata development burden\u201d is especially heavy for resource-limited research and early-stage entrepreneurial efforts. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe goal of a format like Croissant is to make this entire process easier. For instance, the metadata can be leveraged by search engines and dataset repositories to make it easier to find the right dataset. The data resources and organization information make it easier to develop tools for cleaning, refining, and analyzing data. This information and the default ML semantics make it possible for ML frameworks to use the data to train and test models with a minimum of code. Together, these improvements substantially reduce the data development burden.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, dataset authors care about the discoverability and ease of use of their datasets. Adopting Croissant improves the value of their datasets, while only requiring a minimal effort, thanks to the available creation tools and support from ML data platforms.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>What can Croissant do today?</h2>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN40ZSjgTFRIVwAwN2OXIn4vQhmshC8VhcKx-ijY-sCQBH9qDkV3nrFz_YapZ0iAD-Svkyxblt6lpJFFHa4JfDqfY6RIL0RnVhtgBlLyh-1DnH8DUz7-TUSdSUIg5V2piqjmQ5Dw9MISeeSBvnMsie8jRrXOeHXfcTGQi0AHIeOYFuHYwDFSyRmBT8BHum/s908/image1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN40ZSjgTFRIVwAwN2OXIn4vQhmshC8VhcKx-ijY-sCQBH9qDkV3nrFz_YapZ0iAD-Svkyxblt6lpJFFHa4JfDqfY6RIL0RnVhtgBlLyh-1DnH8DUz7-TUSdSUIg5V2piqjmQ5Dw9MISeeSBvnMsie8jRrXOeHXfcTGQi0AHIeOYFuHYwDFSyRmBT8BHum/s16000/image1.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Croissant ecosystem: Users can Search for Croissant datasets, download them from major repositories, and easily load them into their favorite ML frameworks.

The Croissant format doesn't change how the actual data is represented (e.g., image or text file formats) \u2014 it provides a standard way to describe and organize it. Croissant builds upon <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">schema.org</a>, the de facto standard for publishing structured data on the Web, which is already used by over 40M datasets. Croissant augments it with comprehensive layers for ML relevant metadata, data resources, data organization, and default ML semantics.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, we are announcing support from major tools and repositories: Today, three widely used collections of ML datasets \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/datasets\">Kaggle</a>, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=croissant&amp;sort=trending\">Hugging Face</a>, and <a href=\"https://openml.org/search?type=data\">OpenML</a> \u2014 will begin supporting the Croissant format for the datasets they host; the <a href=\"http://g.co/datasetsearch\">Dataset Search</a> tool lets users search for Croissant datasets across the Web; and popular ML frameworks, including <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">TensorFlow</a>, <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\">PyTorch</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/google/jax\">JAX</a>, can load Croissant datasets easily using the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets\">TensorFlow Datasets</a> (TFDS) package.\n</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Croissant</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThis 1.0 release of Croissant includes a complete <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/croissant/1.0\">specification</a> of the format, a set of <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/datasets\">example datasets</a>, an open source <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/python/mlcroissant\">Python library</a> to validate, consume and generate Croissant metadata, and an open source <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/editor\">visual editor</a> to load, inspect and create Croissant dataset descriptions in an intuitive way.\n</p>\n<p>\nSupporting Responsible AI (RAI) was a key goal of the Croissant effort from the start. We are also releasing the first version of the <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/croissant/RAI/1.0\">Croissant RAI vocabulary</a> extension, which augments Croissant with key properties needed to describe important RAI use cases such as data life cycle management, data labeling, participatory data, ML safety and fairness evaluation, explainability, and compliance.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Why a shared format for ML data?</h2>\n<p>\nThe majority of ML work is actually data work. The training data is the \u201ccode\u201d that determines the behavior of a model. Datasets can vary from a collection of text used to train a large language model (LLM) to a collection of driving scenarios (annotated videos) used to train a car\u2019s collision avoidance system. However, the steps to develop an ML model typically follow the same iterative data-centric process: (1) find or collect data, (2) clean and refine the data, (3) train the model on the data, (4) test the model on more data, (5) discover the model does not work, (6) analyze the data to find out why, (7) repeat until a workable model is achieved. Many steps are made harder by the lack of a common format. This \u201cdata development burden\u201d is especially heavy for resource-limited research and early-stage entrepreneurial efforts. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe goal of a format like Croissant is to make this entire process easier. For instance, the metadata can be leveraged by search engines and dataset repositories to make it easier to find the right dataset. The data resources and organization information make it easier to develop tools for cleaning, refining, and analyzing data. This information and the default ML semantics make it possible for ML frameworks to use the data to train and test models with a minimum of code. Together, these improvements substantially reduce the data development burden.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, dataset authors care about the discoverability and ease of use of their datasets. Adopting Croissant improves the value of their datasets, while only requiring a minimal effort, thanks to the available creation tools and support from ML data platforms.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>What can Croissant do today?</h2>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN40ZSjgTFRIVwAwN2OXIn4vQhmshC8VhcKx-ijY-sCQBH9qDkV3nrFz_YapZ0iAD-Svkyxblt6lpJFFHa4JfDqfY6RIL0RnVhtgBlLyh-1DnH8DUz7-TUSdSUIg5V2piqjmQ5Dw9MISeeSBvnMsie8jRrXOeHXfcTGQi0AHIeOYFuHYwDFSyRmBT8BHum/s908/image1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN40ZSjgTFRIVwAwN2OXIn4vQhmshC8VhcKx-ijY-sCQBH9qDkV3nrFz_YapZ0iAD-Svkyxblt6lpJFFHa4JfDqfY6RIL0RnVhtgBlLyh-1DnH8DUz7-TUSdSUIg5V2piqjmQ5Dw9MISeeSBvnMsie8jRrXOeHXfcTGQi0AHIeOYFuHYwDFSyRmBT8BHum/s16000/image1.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Croissant ecosystem: Users can Search for Croissant datasets, download them from major repositories, and easily load them into their favorite ML frameworks.

So much time, in fact, that progress in the field of ML is hampered by a fundamental obstacle: the wide variety of data representations. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<p>\nML datasets cover a broad range of content types, from text and structured data to images, audio, and video. Even within datasets that cover the same types of content, every dataset has a unique <em>ad hoc</em> arrangement of files and data formats. This challenge reduces productivity throughout the entire ML development process, from finding the data to training the model. It also impedes development of badly needed tooling for working with datasets. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere are general purpose metadata formats for datasets such as <a href=\"http://schema.org/Dataset\">schema.org</a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/\">DCAT</a>.

The right tools could help researchers analyze these videos, transforming how we understand the world around us. Videos offer dynamic visual content far more rich than static images, capturing movement, changes, and dynamic relationships between entities. Analyzing this complexity, along with the immense diversity of publicly available video data, demands models that go beyond traditional image understanding. Consequently, many of the approaches that best perform on video understanding still rely on specialized models tailor-made for particular tasks. Recently, there has been exciting progress in this area using video foundation models (ViFMs), such as VideoCLIP, InternVideo, VideoCoCa, and UMT. However, building a ViFM that handles the sheer diversity of video data remains a challenge. With the goal of building a single model for general-purpose video understanding, we introduce \u201cVideoPrism: A Foundational Visual Encoder for Video Understanding\u201d. VideoPrism is a ViFM designed to handle a wide spectrum of video understanding tasks, including classification, localization, retrieval, captioning, and question answering (QA). We propose innovations in both the pre-training data as well as the modeling strategy. We pre-train VideoPrism on a massive and diverse dataset: 36 million high-quality video-text pairs and 582 million video clips with noisy or machine-generated parallel text. Our pre-training approach is designed for this hybrid data, to learn both from video-text pairs and the videos themselves. VideoPrism is incredibly easy to adapt to new video understanding challenges, and achieves state-of-the-art performance using a single frozen model. VideoPrism is a general-purpose video encoder that enables state-of-the-art results over a wide spectrum of video understanding tasks, including classification, localization, retrieval, captioning, and question answering, by producing video representations from a single frozen model. Pre-training data A powerful ViFM needs a very large collection of videos on which to train \u2014 similar to other foundation models (FMs), such as those for large language models (LLMs). Ideally, we would want the pre-training data to be a representative sample of all the videos in the world. While naturally most of these videos do not have perfect captions or descriptions, even imperfect text can provide useful information about the semantic content of the video. To give our model the best possible starting point, we put together a massive pre-training corpus consisting of several public and private datasets, including YT-Temporal-180M, InternVid, VideoCC, WTS-70M, etc. This includes 36 million carefully selected videos with high-quality captions, along with an additional 582 million clips with varying levels of noisy text (like auto-generated transcripts). To our knowledge, this is the largest and most diverse video training corpus of its kind. Statistics on the video-text pre-training data. The large variations of the CLIP similarity scores (the higher, the better) demonstrate the diverse caption quality of our pre-training data, which is a byproduct of the various ways used to harvest the text. Two-stage training The VideoPrism model architecture stems from the standard vision transformer (ViT) with a factorized design that sequentially encodes spatial and temporal information following ViViT. Our training approach leverages both the high-quality video-text data and the video data with noisy text mentioned above. To start, we use contrastive learning (an approach that minimizes the distance between positive video-text pairs while maximizing the distance between negative video-text pairs) to teach our model to match videos with their own text descriptions, including imperfect ones. This builds a foundation for matching semantic language content to visual content. After video-text contrastive training, we leverage the collection of videos without text descriptions. Here, we build on the masked video modeling framework to predict masked patches in a video, with a few improvements. We train the model to predict both the video-level global embedding and token-wise embeddings from the first-stage model to effectively leverage the knowledge acquired in that stage. We then randomly shuffle the predicted tokens to prevent the model from learning shortcuts. What is unique about VideoPrism\u2019s setup is that we use two complementary pre-training signals: text descriptions and the visual content within a video. Text descriptions often focus on what things look like, while the video content provides information about movement and visual dynamics. This enables VideoPrism to excel in tasks that demand an understanding of both appearance and motion. Results We conduct extensive evaluation on VideoPrism across four broad categories of video understanding tasks, including video classification and localization, video-text retrieval, video captioning, question answering, and scientific video understanding. VideoPrism achieves state-of-the-art performance on 30 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks \u2014 all with minimal adaptation of a single, frozen model. VideoPrism compared to the previous best-performing FMs. Classification and localization We evaluate VideoPrism on an existing large-scale video understanding benchmark (VideoGLUE) covering classification and localization tasks. We find that (1) VideoPrism outperforms all of the other state-of-the-art FMs, and (2) no other single model consistently came in second place. This tells us that VideoPrism has learned to effectively pack a variety of video signals into one encoder \u2014 from semantics at different granularities to appearance and motion cues \u2014 and it works well across a variety of video sources. VideoPrism outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (including CLIP, VATT, InternVideo, and UMT) on the video understanding benchmark. In this plot, we show the absolute score differences compared with the previous best model to highlight the relative improvements of VideoPrism. On Charades, ActivityNet, AVA, and AVA-K, we use mean average precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric. On the other datasets, we report top-1 accuracy. Combining with LLMs We further explore combining VideoPrism with LLMs to unlock its ability to handle various video-language tasks. In particular, when paired with a text encoder (following LiT) or a language decoder (such as PaLM-2), VideoPrism can be utilized for video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video QA tasks. We compare the combined models on a broad and challenging set of vision-language benchmarks. VideoPrism sets the new state of the art on most benchmarks. From the visual results, we find that VideoPrism is capable of understanding complex motions and appearances in videos (e.g., the model can recognize the different colors of spinning objects on the window in the visual examples below). These results demonstrate that VideoPrism is strongly compatible with language models. VideoPrism achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art approaches (including VideoCoCa, UMT and Flamingo) on multiple video-text retrieval (top) and video captioning and video QA (bottom) benchmarks. We also show the absolute score differences compared with the previous best model to highlight the relative improvements of VideoPrism. We report the Recall@1 on MASRVTT, VATEX, and ActivityNet, CIDEr score on MSRVTT-Cap, VATEX-Cap, and YouCook2, top-1 accuracy on MSRVTT-QA and MSVD-QA, and WUPS index on NExT-QA. We show qualitative results using VideoPrism with a text encoder for video-text retrieval (first row) and adapted to a language decoder for video QA (second and third row). For video-text retrieval examples, the blue bars indicate the embedding similarities between the videos and the text queries. Scientific applications Finally, we test VideoPrism on datasets used by scientists across domains, including fields such as ethology, behavioral neuroscience, and ecology. These datasets typically require domain expertise to annotate, for which we leverage existing scientific datasets open-sourced by the community including Fly vs. Fly, CalMS21, ChimpACT, and KABR. VideoPrism not only performs exceptionally well, but actually surpasses models designed specifically for those tasks. This suggests tools like VideoPrism have the potential to transform how scientists analyze video data across different fields. VideoPrism outperforms the domain experts on various scientific benchmarks. We show the absolute score differences to highlight the relative improvements of VideoPrism. We report mean average precision (mAP) for all datasets, except for KABR which uses class-averaged top-1 accuracy. Conclusion With VideoPrism, we introduce a powerful and versatile video encoder that sets a new standard for general-purpose video understanding. Our emphasis on both building a massive and varied pre-training dataset and innovative modeling techniques has been validated through our extensive evaluations. Not only does VideoPrism consistently outperform strong baselines, but its unique ability to generalize positions it well for tackling an array of real-world applications. Because of its potential broad use, we are committed to continuing further responsible research in this space, guided by our AI Principles. We hope VideoPrism paves the way for future breakthroughs at the intersection of AI and video analysis, helping to realize the potential of ViFMs across domains such as scientific discovery, education, and healthcare.

The right tools could help researchers analyze these videos, transforming how we understand the world around us.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a> \n<p>\nVideos offer dynamic visual content far more rich than static images, capturing movement, changes, and dynamic relationships between entities. Analyzing this complexity, along with the immense diversity of publicly available video data, demands models that go beyond traditional image understanding. Consequently, many of the approaches that best perform on video understanding still rely on specialized models tailor-made for particular tasks. Recently, there has been exciting progress in this area using video foundation models (ViFMs), such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14084\">VideoCLIP</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03191\">InternVideo</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04979\">VideoCoCa</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16058\">UMT</a>. However, building a ViFM that handles the sheer diversity of video data remains a challenge.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith the goal of building a single model for general-purpose video understanding, we introduce \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217\">VideoPrism: A Foundational Visual Encoder for Video Understanding</a>\u201d. VideoPrism is a ViFM designed to handle a wide spectrum of video understanding tasks, including classification, localization, retrieval, captioning, and question answering (QA). We propose innovations in both the pre-training data as well as the modeling strategy. We pre-train VideoPrism on a massive and diverse dataset: 36 million high-quality video-text pairs and 582 million video clips with noisy or machine-generated parallel text. Our pre-training approach is designed for this hybrid data, to learn both from video-text pairs and the videos themselves. VideoPrism is incredibly easy to adapt to new video understanding challenges, and achieves state-of-the-art performance using a single frozen model.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<video loop=\"\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://github.com/garyzhao/videoprism-blog/raw/main/teaser.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">VideoPrism is a general-purpose video encoder that enables state-of-the-art results over a wide spectrum of video understanding tasks, including classification, localization, retrieval, captioning, and question answering, by producing video representations from a single frozen model.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Pre-training data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA powerful ViFM needs a very large collection of videos on which to train \u2014 similar to other foundation models (FMs), such as those for large language models (LLMs). Ideally, we would want the pre-training data to be a representative sample of all the videos in the world. While naturally most of these videos do not have perfect captions or descriptions, even imperfect text can provide useful information about the semantic content of the video.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo give our model the best possible starting point, we put together a massive pre-training corpus consisting of several public and private datasets, including <a href=\"https://rowanzellers.com/merlot/\">YT-Temporal-180M</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06942\">InternVid</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00679\">VideoCC</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14937\">WTS-70M</a>, etc. This includes 36 million carefully selected videos with high-quality captions, along with an additional 582 million clips with varying levels of noisy text (like auto-generated transcripts). To our knowledge, this is the largest and most diverse video training corpus of its kind.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrhfnM1Rg_xbS1b3ZtydWc0M7zOchLpi5qdj65UaR3mOYbV8SQQqKhUhltYwmkPNqrULdeVeE1nU3gnRkjR7pE-yFaiVRC1al-BxZecsO0aojXFzSDhfv45oZoOBeYA93IiNeCGdnUryh4HLc3w7Qr2PX0fy6-4qFMTKBORA_PfHspp7Nr1OW0WnAvn-S9/s1999/image18.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrhfnM1Rg_xbS1b3ZtydWc0M7zOchLpi5qdj65UaR3mOYbV8SQQqKhUhltYwmkPNqrULdeVeE1nU3gnRkjR7pE-yFaiVRC1al-BxZecsO0aojXFzSDhfv45oZoOBeYA93IiNeCGdnUryh4HLc3w7Qr2PX0fy6-4qFMTKBORA_PfHspp7Nr1OW0WnAvn-S9/s16000/image18.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Statistics on the video-text pre-training data. The large variations of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14806\">CLIP similarity scores</a>&nbsp;(the higher, the better) demonstrate the diverse caption quality of our pre-training data, which is a byproduct of the various ways used to harvest the text.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Two-stage training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nThe VideoPrism model architecture stems from the standard <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929\">vision transformer</a> (ViT) with a factorized design that sequentially encodes spatial and temporal information following <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15691\">ViViT</a>. Our training approach leverages both the high-quality video-text data and the video data with noisy text mentioned above. To start, we use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning#Contrastive_self-supervised_learning\">contrastive learning</a> (an approach that minimizes the distance between positive video-text pairs while maximizing the distance between negative video-text pairs) to teach our model to match videos with their own text descriptions, including imperfect ones. This builds a foundation for matching semantic language content to visual content.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter video-text contrastive training, we leverage the collection of videos without text descriptions. Here, we build on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04500\">masked video modeling framework</a> to predict masked patches in a video, with a few improvements. We train the model to predict both the video-level global embedding and token-wise embeddings from the first-stage model to effectively leverage the knowledge acquired in that stage. We then randomly shuffle the predicted tokens to prevent the model from learning shortcuts.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat is unique about VideoPrism\u2019s setup is that we use two complementary pre-training signals: text descriptions and the visual content within a video. Text descriptions often focus on what things look like, while the video content provides information about movement and visual dynamics. This enables VideoPrism to excel in tasks that demand an understanding of both appearance and motion.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe conduct extensive evaluation on VideoPrism across four broad categories of video understanding tasks, including video classification and localization, video-text retrieval, video captioning, question answering, and scientific video understanding. VideoPrism achieves state-of-the-art performance on 30 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks \u2014 all with minimal adaptation of a single, frozen model.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiUtXCxgEXrgAZJ2B-Mn8L0DP7VkFUfUbI1yLTgGYSbWtn_Q5AjgGRgi3yQ5PMB3fVFlHLzDP4yhlCeGaPpdXr5I1-TNYelYMUBYiXx16qNYTpqKwAqXX7-EFV-4Asn6qYFWOb6_5p71n5Zzxbt-ZeUy5yIj2aieKXl0LnFOqdhKXa56xm4ZoXbccYDz3H/s1999/image20.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiUtXCxgEXrgAZJ2B-Mn8L0DP7VkFUfUbI1yLTgGYSbWtn_Q5AjgGRgi3yQ5PMB3fVFlHLzDP4yhlCeGaPpdXr5I1-TNYelYMUBYiXx16qNYTpqKwAqXX7-EFV-4Asn6qYFWOb6_5p71n5Zzxbt-ZeUy5yIj2aieKXl0LnFOqdhKXa56xm4ZoXbccYDz3H/w628-h640/image20.png\" width=\"628\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">VideoPrism compared to the previous best-performing FMs.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\"><br />\n</div> \n\n<h3>Classification and localization</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWe evaluate VideoPrism on an existing large-scale video understanding benchmark (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03166\">VideoGLUE</a>) covering classification and localization tasks.

In particular, when paired with a text encoder (following <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07991\">LiT</a>) or a language decoder (such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10403\">PaLM-2</a>), VideoPrism can be utilized for video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video QA tasks. We compare the combined models on a broad and challenging set of vision-language benchmarks. VideoPrism sets the new state of the art on most benchmarks. From the visual results, we find that VideoPrism is capable of understanding complex motions and appearances in videos (e.g., the model can recognize the different colors of spinning objects on the window in the visual examples below).

      "summary_original": "Posted by Zheng Xu, Research Scientist, and Yanxiang Zhang, Software Engineer, Google Language models (LMs) trained to predict the next word given input text are the key technology for many applications [1, 2]. In Gboard, LMs are used to improve users\u2019 typing experience by supporting features like next word prediction (NWP), Smart Compose, smart completion and suggestion, slide to type, and proofread. Deploying models on users\u2019 devices rather than enterprise servers has advantages like lower latency and better privacy for model usage. While training on-device models directly from user data effectively improves the utility performance for applications such as NWP and smart text selection, protecting the privacy of user data for model training is important. Gboard features powered by on-device language models. In this blog we discuss how years of research advances now power the private training of Gboard LMs, since the proof-of-concept development of federated learning (FL) in 2017 and formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees in 2022. FL enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a model while keeping all the training data on device, and DP provides a quantifiable measure of data anonymization. Formally, DP is often characterized by (\u03b5, \u03b4) with smaller values representing stronger guarantees. Machine learning (ML) models are considered to have reasonable DP guarantees for \u03b5=10 and strong DP guarantees for \u03b5=1 when \u03b4 is small. As of today, all NWP neural network LMs in Gboard are trained with FL with formal DP guarantees, and all future launches of Gboard LMs trained on user data require DP. These 30+ Gboard on-device LMs are launched in 7+ languages and 15+ countries, and satisfy (\u025b, \u03b4)-DP guarantees of small \u03b4 of 10-10 and \u025b between 0.994 and 13.69. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest known deployment of user-level DP in production at Google or anywhere, and the first time a strong DP guarantee of \u025b < 1 is announced for models trained directly on user data. Privacy principles and practices in Gboard In \u201cPrivate Federated Learning in Gboard\u201d, we discussed how different privacy principles are currently reflected in production models, including: Transparency and user control: We provide disclosure of what data is used, what purpose it is used for, how it is processed in various channels, and how Gboard users can easily configure the data usage in learning models. Data minimization: FL immediately aggregates only focused updates that improve a specific model. Secure aggregation (SecAgg) is an encryption method to further guarantee that only aggregated results of the ephemeral updates can be accessed. Data anonymization: DP is applied by the server to prevent models from memorizing the unique information in individual user\u2019s training data. Auditability and verifiability: We have made public the key algorithmic approaches and privacy accounting in open-sourced code (TFF aggregator, TFP DPQuery, DP accounting, and FL system). A brief history In recent years, FL has become the default method for training Gboard on-device LMs from user data. In 2020, a DP mechanism that clips and adds noise to model updates was used to prevent memorization for training the Spanish LM in Spain, which satisfies finite DP guarantees (Tier 3 described in \u201cHow to DP-fy ML\u201c guide). In 2022, with the help of the DP-Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) algorithm, the Spanish LM became the first production neural network trained directly on user data announced with a formal DP guarantee of (\u03b5=8.9, \u03b4=10-10)-DP (equivalent to the reported \u03c1=0.81 zero-Concentrated-Differential-Privacy), and therefore satisfies reasonable privacy guarantees (Tier 2). Differential privacy by default in federated learning In \u201cFederated Learning of Gboard Language Models with Differential Privacy\u201d, we announced that all the NWP neural network LMs in Gboard have DP guarantees, and all future launches of Gboard LMs trained on user data require DP guarantees. DP is enabled in FL by applying the following practices: Pre-train the model with the multilingual C4 dataset. Via simulation experiments on public datasets, find a large DP-noise-to-signal ratio that allows for high utility. Increasing the number of clients contributing to one round of model update improves privacy while keeping the noise ratio fixed for good utility, up to the point the DP target is met, or the maximum allowed by the system and the size of the population. Configure the parameter to restrict the frequency each client can contribute (e.g., once every few days) based on computation budget and estimated population in the FL system. Run DP-FTRL training with limits on the magnitude of per-device updates chosen either via adaptive clipping, or fixed based on experience. SecAgg can be additionally applied by adopting the advances in improving computation and communication for scales and sensitivity. Federated learning with differential privacy and (SecAgg). Reporting DP guarantees The DP guarantees of launched Gboard NWP LMs are visualized in the barplot below. The x-axis shows LMs labeled by language-locale and trained on corresponding populations; the y-axis shows the \u03b5 value when \u03b4 is fixed to a small value of 10-10 for (\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP (lower is better). The utility of these models are either significantly better than previous non-neural models in production, or comparable with previous LMs without DP, measured based on user-interactions metrics during A/B testing. For example, by applying the best practices, the DP guarantee of the Spanish model in Spain is improved from \u03b5=8.9 to \u03b5=5.37. SecAgg is additionally used for training the Spanish model in Spain and English model in the US. More details of the DP guarantees are reported in the appendix following the guidelines outlined in \u201cHow to DP-fy ML\u201d. Towards stronger DP guarantees The \u03b5~10 DP guarantees of many launched LMs are already considered reasonable for ML models in practice, while the journey of DP FL in Gboard continues for improving user typing experience while protecting data privacy. We are excited to announce that, for the first time, production LMs of Portuguese in Brazil and Spanish in Latin America are trained and launched with a DP guarantee of \u03b5 \u2264 1, which satisfies Tier 1 strong privacy guarantees. Specifically, the (\u03b5=0.994, \u03b4=10-10)-DP guarantee is achieved by running the advanced Matrix Factorization DP-FTRL (MF-DP-FTRL) algorithm, with 12,000+ devices participating in every training round of server model update larger than the common setting of 6500+ devices, and a carefully configured policy to restrict each client to at most participate twice in the total 2000 rounds of training in 14 days in the large Portuguese user population of Brazil. Using a similar setting, the es-US Spanish LM was trained in a large population combining multiple countries in Latin America to achieve (\u03b5=0.994, \u03b4=10-10)-DP. The \u03b5 \u2264 1 es-US model significantly improved the utility in many countries, and launched in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela. For the smaller population in Spain, the DP guarantee of es-ES LM is improved from \u03b5=5.37 to \u03b5=3.42 by only replacing DP-FTRL with MF-DP-FTRL without increasing the number of devices participating every round. More technical details are disclosed in the colab for privacy accounting. DP guarantees for Gboard NWP LMs (the purple bar represents the first es-ES launch of \u03b5=8.9; cyan bars represent privacy improvements for models trained with MF-DP-FTRL; tiers are from \u201cHow to DP-fy ML\u201c guide; en-US* and es-ES* are additionally trained with SecAgg). Discussion and next steps Our experience suggests that DP can be achieved in practice through system algorithm co-design on client participation, and that both privacy and utility can be strong when populations are large and a large number of devices' contributions are aggregated. Privacy-utility-computation trade-offs can be improved by using public data, the new MF-DP-FTRL algorithm, and tightening accounting. With these techniques, a strong DP guarantee of \u03b5 \u2264 1 is possible but still challenging. Active research on empirical privacy auditing [1, 2] suggests that DP models are potentially more private than the worst-case DP guarantees imply. While we keep pushing the frontier of algorithms, which dimension of privacy-utility-computation should be prioritized? We are actively working on all privacy aspects of ML, including extending DP-FTRL to distributed DP and improving auditability and verifiability. Trusted Execution Environment opens the opportunity for substantially increasing the model size with verifiable privacy. The recent breakthrough in large LMs (LLMs) motivates us to rethink the usage of public information in private training and more future interactions between LLMs, on-device LMs, and Gboard production.

We are excited to announce that, for the first time, production LMs of Portuguese in Brazil and Spanish in Latin America are trained and launched with a DP guarantee of  <em>\u03b5</em> \u2264 1, which satisfies <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/05/making-ml-models-differentially-private.html\">Tier 1 strong privacy guarantees</a>. Specifically, the (<em>\u03b5</em>=0.994, <em>\u03b4</em>=10<sup>-10</sup>)-DP guarantee is achieved by running the advanced <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08153\">Matrix Factorization DP-FTRL</a> (MF-DP-FTRL) algorithm, with 12,000+ devices participating in every training round of server model update larger than the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18465\">common setting of 6500+ devices</a>, and a carefully configured policy to restrict each client to at most participate twice in the total 2000 rounds of training in 14 days in the large Portuguese user population of Brazil. Using a similar setting, the es-US Spanish LM was trained in a large population combining multiple countries in Latin America to achieve (<em>\u03b5</em>=0.994, <em>\u03b4</em>=10<sup>-10</sup>)-DP. The <em>\u03b5</em> \u2264 1 es-US model significantly improved the utility in many countries, and launched in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Dustin Zelle, Software Engineer, Google Research, and Arno Eigenwillig, Software Engineer, CoreML Objects and their relationships are ubiquitous in the world around us, and relationships can be as important to understanding an object as its own attributes viewed in isolation \u2014 take for example transportation networks, production networks, knowledge graphs, or social networks. Discrete mathematics and computer science have a long history of formalizing such networks as graphs, consisting of nodes connected by edges in various irregular ways. Yet most machine learning (ML) algorithms allow only for regular and uniform relations between input objects, such as a grid of pixels, a sequence of words, or no relation at all. Graph neural networks, or GNNs for short, have emerged as a powerful technique to leverage both the graph\u2019s connectivity (as in the older algorithms DeepWalk and Node2Vec) and the input features on the various nodes and edges. GNNs can make predictions for graphs as a whole (Does this molecule react in a certain way?), for individual nodes (What\u2019s the topic of this document, given its citations?) or for potential edges (Is this product likely to be purchased together with that product?). Apart from making predictions about graphs, GNNs are a powerful tool used to bridge the chasm to more typical neural network use cases. They encode a graph's discrete, relational information in a continuous way so that it can be included naturally in another deep learning system. We are excited to announce the release of TensorFlow GNN 1.0 (TF-GNN), a production-tested library for building GNNs at large scales. It supports both modeling and training in TensorFlow as well as the extraction of input graphs from huge data stores. TF-GNN is built from the ground up for heterogeneous graphs, where types of objects and relations are represented by distinct sets of nodes and edges. Real-world objects and their relations occur in distinct types, and TF-GNN's heterogeneous focus makes it natural to represent them. Inside TensorFlow, such graphs are represented by objects of type tfgnn.GraphTensor. This is a composite tensor type (a collection of tensors in one Python class) accepted as a first-class citizen in tf.data.Dataset, tf.function, etc. It stores both the graph structure and its features attached to nodes, edges and the graph as a whole. Trainable transformations of GraphTensors can be defined as Layers objects in the high-level Keras API, or directly using the tfgnn.GraphTensor primitive. GNNs: Making predictions for an object in context For illustration, let\u2019s look at one typical application of TF-GNN: predicting a property of a certain type of node in a graph defined by cross-referencing tables of a huge database. For example, a citation database of Computer Science (CS) arXiv papers with one-to-many cites and many-to-one cited relationships where we would like to predict the subject area of each paper. Like most neural networks, a GNN is trained on a dataset of many labeled examples (~millions), but each training step consists only of a much smaller batch of training examples (say, hundreds). To scale to millions, the GNN gets trained on a stream of reasonably small subgraphs from the underlying graph. Each subgraph contains enough of the original data to compute the GNN result for the labeled node at its center and train the model. This process \u2014 typically referred to as subgraph sampling \u2014 is extremely consequential for GNN training. Most existing tooling accomplishes sampling in a batch way, producing static subgraphs for training. TF-GNN provides tooling to improve on this by sampling dynamically and interactively. Pictured, the process of subgraph sampling where small, tractable subgraphs are sampled from a larger graph to create input examples for GNN training. TF-GNN 1.0 debuts a flexible Python API to configure dynamic or batch subgraph sampling at all relevant scales: interactively in a Colab notebook (like this one), for efficient sampling of a small dataset stored in the main memory of a single training host, or distributed by Apache Beam for huge datasets stored on a network filesystem (up to hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges). For details, please refer to our user guides for in-memory and beam-based sampling, respectively. On those same sampled subgraphs, the GNN\u2019s task is to compute a hidden (or latent) state at the root node; the hidden state aggregates and encodes the relevant information of the root node's neighborhood. One classical approach is message-passing neural networks. In each round of message passing, nodes receive messages from their neighbors along incoming edges and update their own hidden state from them. After n rounds, the hidden state of the root node reflects the aggregate information from all nodes within n edges (pictured below for n = 2). The messages and the new hidden states are computed by hidden layers of the neural network. In a heterogeneous graph, it often makes sense to use separately trained hidden layers for the different types of nodes and edges Pictured, a simple message-passing neural network where, at each step, the node state is propagated from outer to inner nodes where it is pooled to compute new node states. Once the root node is reached, a final prediction can be made. The training setup is completed by placing an output layer on top of the GNN\u2019s hidden state for the labeled nodes, computing the loss (to measure the prediction error), and updating model weights by backpropagation, as usual in any neural network training. Beyond supervised training (i.e., minimizing a loss defined by labels), GNNs can also be trained in an unsupervised way (i.e., without labels). This lets us compute a continuous representation (or embedding) of the discrete graph structure of nodes and their features. These representations are then typically utilized in other ML systems. In this way, the discrete, relational information encoded by a graph can be included in more typical neural network use cases. TF-GNN supports a fine-grained specification of unsupervised objectives for heterogeneous graphs. Building GNN architectures The TF-GNN library supports building and training GNNs at various levels of abstraction. At the highest level, users can take any of the predefined models bundled with the library that are expressed in Keras layers. Besides a small collection of models from the research literature, TF-GNN comes with a highly configurable model template that provides a curated selection of modeling choices that we have found to provide strong baselines on many of our in-house problems. The templates implement GNN layers; users need only to initialize the Keras layers. At the lowest level, users can write a GNN model from scratch in terms of primitives for passing data around the graph, such as broadcasting data from a node to all its outgoing edges or pooling data into a node from all its incoming edges (e.g., computing the sum of incoming messages). TF-GNN\u2019s graph data model treats nodes, edges and whole input graphs equally when it comes to features or hidden states, making it straightforward to express not only node-centric models like the MPNN discussed above but also more general forms of GraphNets. This can, but need not, be done with Keras as a modeling framework on the top of core TensorFlow. For more details, and intermediate levels of modeling, see the TF-GNN user guide and model collection. Training orchestration While advanced users are free to do custom model training, the TF-GNN Runner also provides a succinct way to orchestrate the training of Keras models in the common cases. A simple invocation may look like this: The Runner provides ready-to-use solutions for ML pains like distributed training and tfgnn.GraphTensor padding for fixed shapes on Cloud TPUs. Beyond training on a single task (as shown above), it supports joint training on multiple (two or more) tasks in concert. For example, unsupervised tasks can be mixed with supervised ones to inform a final continuous representation (or embedding) with application specific inductive biases. Callers only need substitute the task argument with a mapping of tasks: Additionally, the TF-GNN Runner also includes an implementation of integrated gradients for use in model attribution. Integrated gradients output is a GraphTensor with the same connectivity as the observed GraphTensor but its features replaced with gradient values where larger values contribute more than smaller values in the GNN prediction. Users can inspect gradient values to see which features their GNN uses the most. Conclusion In short, we hope TF-GNN will be useful to advance the application of GNNs in TensorFlow at scale and fuel further innovation in the field.

For details, please refer to our user guides for <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/inmemory_sampler.md\">in-memory</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/beam_sampler.md\">beam-based</a> sampling, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn those same sampled subgraphs, the GNN\u2019s task is to compute a hidden (or latent) state at the root node; the hidden state aggregates and encodes the relevant information of the root node's neighborhood. One classical approach is <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/neural-message-passing-for-quantum-chemistry/\">message-passing neural networks</a>. In each round of message passing, nodes receive messages from their neighbors along incoming edges and update their own hidden state from them. After <em>n</em> rounds, the hidden state of the root node reflects the aggregate information from all nodes within <em>n</em> edges (pictured below for <em>n</em> = 2). The messages and the new hidden states are computed by hidden layers of the neural network. In a heterogeneous graph, it often makes sense to use separately trained hidden layers for the different types of nodes and edges\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMrCrQ1SCcwhZfE33X46EifocYAmKCPXMVe1d4na1V6flQavJ_f_FKtnlQbe2vnvzbSEtx5mxJHZ2OlQbO9rsiEhiPLY1PKQOT-EwahobMIVC92PZJs8RroEuYswHCpEjjpwqPrpqzKsDgrNaiY4lM_E8NVnxVRsYn0PNxe3TghByKJpW9V_YRD0RnNnm4/s573/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMrCrQ1SCcwhZfE33X46EifocYAmKCPXMVe1d4na1V6flQavJ_f_FKtnlQbe2vnvzbSEtx5mxJHZ2OlQbO9rsiEhiPLY1PKQOT-EwahobMIVC92PZJs8RroEuYswHCpEjjpwqPrpqzKsDgrNaiY4lM_E8NVnxVRsYn0PNxe3TghByKJpW9V_YRD0RnNnm4/s16000/image1.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pictured, a simple message-passing neural network where, at each step, the node state is propagated from outer to inner nodes where it is pooled to compute new node states.

This lets us compute a <em>continuous</em> representation (or <em>embedding</em>) of the <em>discrete</em> graph structure of nodes and their features. These representations are then typically utilized in other ML systems. In this way, the discrete, relational information encoded by a graph can be included in more typical neural network use cases.

Besides a small collection of models from the research literature, TF-GNN comes with a highly configurable model template that provides a curated selection of modeling choices that we have found to provide strong baselines on many of our in-house problems. The templates implement GNN layers; users need only to initialize the Keras layers.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMfB8QoX14UU1GEAmFFOP0cAj__zxa_MKzVSiJoak9cVLNdbbhrSxbIWhqQM3OYKA5lo7zW8sWr6-9utm-rw0808rBOE4Cbw7NZxcmifenvF6DCH4opWhVQJHR-MLGcFoNu_WpET5h1PZRdXMhjcyKgBg3NchNTPq6gWVVluzcQNaO5qtonVp5KnJRgUaD/s1400/TFGNN%20code1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMfB8QoX14UU1GEAmFFOP0cAj__zxa_MKzVSiJoak9cVLNdbbhrSxbIWhqQM3OYKA5lo7zW8sWr6-9utm-rw0808rBOE4Cbw7NZxcmifenvF6DCH4opWhVQJHR-MLGcFoNu_WpET5h1PZRdXMhjcyKgBg3NchNTPq6gWVVluzcQNaO5qtonVp5KnJRgUaD/s16000/TFGNN%20code1.png\" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nAt the lowest level, users can write a GNN model from scratch in terms of primitives for passing data around the graph, such as broadcasting data from a node to all its outgoing edges or pooling data into a node from all its incoming edges (e.g., computing the sum of incoming messages). TF-GNN\u2019s graph data model treats nodes, edges and whole input graphs equally when it comes to features or hidden states, making it straightforward to express not only node-centric models like the MPNN discussed above but also more general forms of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261\">GraphNets</a>.

Discrete mathematics and computer science have a long history of formalizing such networks as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\">graphs</a></em>, consisting of <em>nodes</em> connected by <em>edges</em> in various irregular ways. Yet most machine learning (ML) algorithms allow only for regular and uniform relations between input objects, such as a grid of pixels, a sequence of words, or no relation at all. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/\">Graph neural networks</a>, or GNNs for short, have emerged as a powerful technique to leverage both the graph\u2019s connectivity (as in the older algorithms <a href=\"http://perozzi.net/projects/deepwalk/\">DeepWalk</a> and <a href=\"https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/\">Node2Vec</a>) and the input features on the various nodes and edges. GNNs can make predictions for graphs as a whole (Does this molecule react in a certain way?), for individual nodes (What\u2019s the topic of this document, given its citations?) or for potential edges (Is this product likely to be purchased together with that product?). Apart from making predictions about graphs, GNNs are a powerful tool used to bridge the chasm to more typical neural network use cases. They encode a graph's <em>discrete</em>, <em>relational</em> information in a <em>continuous</em> way so that it can be included naturally in another deep learning system.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are excited to announce the release of <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn\">TensorFlow GNN 1.0</a> (TF-GNN), a production-tested library for building GNNs at large scales. It supports both modeling and training in TensorFlow as well as the extraction of input graphs from huge data stores. TF-GNN is built from the ground up for heterogeneous graphs, where types of objects and relations are represented by distinct sets of nodes and edges. Real-world objects and their relations occur in distinct types, and TF-GNN's heterogeneous focus makes it natural to represent them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Inside TensorFlow, such graphs are represented by objects of type <code>tfgnn.GraphTensor</code>. This is a composite tensor type (a collection of tensors in one Python class) accepted as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen\">first-class citizen</a> in <code>tf.data.Dataset</code>, <code>tf.function</code>, etc. It stores both the graph structure and its features attached to nodes, edges and the graph as a whole. Trainable transformations of GraphTensors can be defined as Layers objects in the high-level <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras\">Keras API</a>, or directly using the <code>tfgnn.GraphTensor</code> primitive.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>GNNs: Making predictions for an object in context</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nFor illustration, let\u2019s look at one typical application of TF-GNN: predicting a property of a certain type of node in a graph defined by cross-referencing tables of a huge database. For example, a citation database of Computer Science (CS) arXiv papers with one-to-many cites and many-to-one cited relationships where we would like to predict the subject area of each paper.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most neural networks, a GNN is trained on a dataset of many labeled examples (~millions), but each training step consists only of a much smaller batch of training examples (say, hundreds). To scale to millions, the GNN gets trained on a stream of reasonably small subgraphs from the underlying graph. Each subgraph contains enough of the original data to compute the GNN result for the labeled node at its center and train the model. This process \u2014 typically referred to as subgraph sampling \u2014 is extremely consequential for GNN training. Most existing tooling accomplishes sampling in a batch way, producing static subgraphs for training. TF-GNN provides tooling to improve on this by sampling dynamically and interactively. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhE36FVnslwVrX4LjLgpe5NOcVgJ2WSHCaw64LT9pMhjhHOFt-1pjp1AhaXqjxfEODX04Buw93D1G36HOStu5_mWUEdNs0gZTa1c7MXJ6ir9DYOp_HCYpFMT5NZiBbHxNwvUmF-dwhN2rgKQX0CeFY25X9aFnoD0W7bzL_xtkDJFdP0guocAJDSOgBHIiZm/s800/image2.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhE36FVnslwVrX4LjLgpe5NOcVgJ2WSHCaw64LT9pMhjhHOFt-1pjp1AhaXqjxfEODX04Buw93D1G36HOStu5_mWUEdNs0gZTa1c7MXJ6ir9DYOp_HCYpFMT5NZiBbHxNwvUmF-dwhN2rgKQX0CeFY25X9aFnoD0W7bzL_xtkDJFdP0guocAJDSOgBHIiZm/s16000/image2.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pictured, the process of subgraph sampling where small, tractable subgraphs are sampled from a larger graph to create input examples for GNN training.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nTF-GNN 1.0 debuts a flexible Python API to configure dynamic or batch subgraph sampling at all relevant scales: interactively in a Colab notebook (like <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/gnn/blob/master/examples/notebooks/ogbn_mag_e2e.ipynb\">this one</a>), for efficient sampling of a small dataset stored in the main memory of a single training host, or distributed by <a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/\">Apache Beam</a> for huge datasets stored on a network filesystem (up to hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges).

For more details, and intermediate levels of modeling, see the TF-GNN <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/gnn_modeling.md\">user guide</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/tree/main/tensorflow_gnn/models\">model collection</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Training orchestration</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWhile advanced users are free to do custom model training, the <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/runner.md\">TF-GNN Runner</a> also provides a succinct way to orchestrate the training of Keras models in the common cases.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Rajat Sen and Yichen Zhou, Google Research Time-series forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the M5 competition). At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, retrieval-augmented generation, and code completion. These models are trained on massive amounts of textual data derived from a variety of sources like common crawl and open-source code that allows them to identify patterns in languages. This makes them very powerful zero-shot tools; for instance, when paired with retrieval, they can answer questions about and summarize current events. Despite DL-based forecasters largely outperforming traditional methods and progress being made in reducing training and inference costs, they face challenges: most DL architectures require long and involved training and validation cycles before a customer can test the model on a new time-series. A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like retail demand planning. To that end, in \u201cA decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in Google Cloud Vertex AI. A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting LLMs are usually trained in a decoder-only fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal transformer layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the i-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (i+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d. A foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and feedforward layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent long-horizon forecasting work. The task then is to forecast the (i+1)-th patch of time-points given the i-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. However, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a multilayer perceptron block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with positional encodings (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in long-horizon forecasting. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length. Consider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting TimesFM architecture. Pretraining data Just like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve. We have spent a great amount of time creating and assessing our training datasets, and the following is what we have found works best: Synthetic data helps with the basics. Meaningful synthetic time-series data can be generated using statistical models or physical simulations. These basic temporal patterns can teach the model the grammar of time series forecasting. Real-world data adds real-world flavor. We comb through available public time series datasets, and selectively put together a large corpus of 100 billion time-points. Among these datasets there are Google Trends and Wikipedia Pageviews, which track what people are interested in, and that nicely mirrors trends and patterns in many other real-world time series. This helps TimesFM understand the bigger picture and generalize better when provided with domain-specific contexts not seen during training. Zero-shot evaluation results We evaluate TimesFM zero-shot on data not seen during training using popular time-series benchmarks. We observe that TimesFM performs better than most statistical methods like ARIMA, ETS and can match or outperform powerful DL models like DeepAR, PatchTST that have been explicitly trained on the target time-series. We used the Monash Forecasting Archive to evaluate TimesFM\u2019s out-of-the-box performance. This archive contains tens of thousands of time-series from various domains like traffic, weather, and demand forecasting covering frequencies ranging from few minutes to yearly data. Following existing literature, we inspect the mean absolute error (MAE) appropriately scaled so that it can be averaged across the datasets. We see that zero-shot (ZS) TimesFM is better than most supervised approaches, including recent deep learning models. We also compare TimesFM to GPT-3.5 for forecasting using a specific prompting technique proposed by llmtime(ZS). We demonstrate that TimesFM performs better than llmtime(ZS) despite being orders of magnitude smaller. Scaled MAE (the lower the better) of TimesFM(ZS) against other supervised and zero-shot approaches on Monash datasets. Most of the Monash datasets are short or medium horizon, i.e., the prediction length is not too long. We also test TimesFM on popular benchmarks for long horizon forecasting against a recent state-of-the-art baseline PatchTST (and other long-horizon forecasting baselines). In the next figure, we plot the MAE on ETT datasets for the task of predicting 96 and 192 time-points into the future. The metric has been calculated on the last test window of each dataset (as done by the llmtime paper). We see that TimesFM not only surpasses the performance of llmtime(ZS) but also matches that of the supervised PatchTST model explicitly trained on the respective datasets. Last window MAE (the lower the better) of TimesFM(ZS) against llmtime(ZS) and long-horizon forecasting baselines on ETT datasets. Conclusion We train a decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting using a large pretraining corpus of 100B real world time-points, the majority of which was search interest time-series data derived from Google Trends and pageviews from Wikipedia. We show that even a relatively small 200M parameter pretrained model that uses our TimesFM architecture displays impressive zero-shot performance on a variety of public benchmarks from different domains and granularities.

Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001874\">M5 competition</a>).\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nAt the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\">translation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/\">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion\">code completion</a>. These models are trained on massive amounts of <em>textual </em>data derived from a variety of sources like <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\">common crawl</a> and open-source code that allows them to identify patterns in languages. This makes them very powerful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning\">zero-shot</a> tools; for instance, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/\">when paired with retrieval</a>, they can answer questions about and summarize current events.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDespite DL-based forecasters largely <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110\">outperforming</a> traditional methods and progress being made in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting\">reducing training and inference costs</a>, they face challenges: most DL architectures require <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting\">long and involved training and validation cycles</a> before a customer can test the model on a new time-series. A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning\">retail demand planning</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf\">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python\">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nLLMs are usually trained in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf\">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network\">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/\">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424\">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nConsider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve.

Among these datasets there are <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view\">Wikipedia Pageviews</a>, which track what people are interested in, and that nicely mirrors trends and patterns in many other real-world time series. This helps TimesFM understand the bigger picture and generalize better when provided with domain-specific contexts not seen during training.\n</p></div>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Zero-shot evaluation results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe evaluate TimesFM zero-shot on data not seen during training using popular time-series benchmarks.

A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning\">retail demand planning</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf\">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python\">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nLLMs are usually trained in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf\">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network\">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/\">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424\">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nConsider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve.

Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001874\">M5 competition</a>).\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nAt the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\">translation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/\">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion\">code completion</a>.

A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning\">retail demand planning</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf\">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python\">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nLLMs are usually trained in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf\">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network\">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/\">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424\">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nConsider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve.

Among these datasets there are <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view\">Wikipedia Pageviews</a>, which track what people are interested in, and that nicely mirrors trends and patterns in many other real-world time series.

During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network\">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/\">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424\">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nConsider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve.

In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/notes-from-the-ai-frontier-applications-and-value-of-deep-learning\">improving demand forecasting accuracy</a> can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001874\">M5 competition</a>).\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nAt the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\">translation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/\">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion\">code completion</a>. These models are trained on massive amounts of <em>textual </em>data derived from a variety of sources like <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\">common crawl</a> and open-source code that allows them to identify patterns in languages. This makes them very powerful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning\">zero-shot</a> tools; for instance, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/\">when paired with retrieval</a>, they can answer questions about and summarize current events.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDespite DL-based forecasters largely <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110\">outperforming</a> traditional methods and progress being made in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting\">reducing training and inference costs</a>, they face challenges: most DL architectures require <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting\">long and involved training and validation cycles</a> before a customer can test the model on a new time-series. A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning\">retail demand planning</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf\">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python\">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nLLMs are usually trained in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf\">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token.

Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001874\">M5 competition</a>).\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nAt the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\">translation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/\">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion\">code completion</a>.

A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning\">retail demand planning</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo that end, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf\">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>\u201d, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python\">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nLLMs are usually trained in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf\">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d, it might generate the token \u201cThe\u201d, then condition on \u201cWhat is the capital of France? The\u201d to generate the next token \u201ccapital\u201d and so on until it generates the complete answer: \u201cThe capital of France is Paris\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network\">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/\">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424\">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nConsider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve. We have spent a great amount of time creating and assessing our training datasets, and the following is what we have found works best:\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<p>\n\n    <strong>Synthetic data helps with the basics.</strong> Meaningful synthetic time-series data can be generated using statistical models or physical simulations. These basic temporal patterns can teach the model the grammar of time series forecasting.\n</p></div>\n  \n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<p>  \n    <strong>Real-world data adds real-world flavor.</strong> We comb through available public time series datasets, and selectively put together a large corpus of 100 billion time-points. Among these datasets there are <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view\">Wikipedia Pageviews</a>, which track what people are interested in, and that nicely mirrors trends and patterns in many other real-world time series. This helps TimesFM understand the bigger picture and generalize better when provided with domain-specific contexts not seen during training.\n</p></div>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Zero-shot evaluation results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe evaluate TimesFM zero-shot on data not seen during training using popular time-series benchmarks. We observe that TimesFM performs better than most statistical methods like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average\">ARIMA</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing\">ETS</a> and can match or outperform powerful DL models like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110\">DeepAR</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730\">PatchTST</a> that have been <em>explicitly trained</em> on the target time-series.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe used the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/monash_tsf\">Monash Forecasting Archive</a> to evaluate TimesFM\u2019s out-of-the-box performance. This archive contains tens of thousands of time-series from various domains like traffic, weather, and demand forecasting covering frequencies ranging from few minutes to yearly data. Following existing literature, we inspect the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error\">mean absolute error</a> (MAE) <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820\">appropriately scaled</a> so that it can be averaged across the datasets. We see that zero-shot (ZS) TimesFM is better than most supervised approaches, including recent deep learning models. We also compare TimesFM to <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\">GPT-3.5</a> for forecasting using a specific prompting technique proposed by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820\">llmtime(ZS)</a>.

During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting\n</p>\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s1084/image3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4G0lBOLUqlPIXJ3R68kjS984MBIKBPDBrCWtgmjVVTyQRqY6-rn3aHJjgxCbG-8csyBLsp0POILdeJ2VcsRy8lrip0k5DWsUpuL9LU1qOPXLW99mraNdd6HVU791NYqJeTyY7LjuMnOIo6RGmkxBQqqaPrSsC0dELrwy21QUs1Jgwxr8flmdNkDV2tZsT/s16000/image3.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">TimesFM architecture.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br />\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Pretraining data</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nJust like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Rishabh Tiwari, Pre-doctoral Researcher, and Pradeep Shenoy, Research Scientist, Google Research Machine learning models in the real world are often trained on limited data that may contain unintended statistical biases. For example, in the CELEBA celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting \u201cblond\u201d as the hair color for most female faces \u2014 here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as medical diagnosis. Surprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to amplify such statistical biases, through the so-called simplicity bias of deep learning. This bias is the tendency of deep networks to identify weakly predictive features early in the training, and continue to anchor on these features, failing to identify more complex and potentially more accurate features. With the above in mind, we propose simple and effective fixes to this dual challenge of spurious features and simplicity bias by applying early readouts and feature forgetting. First, in \u201cUsing Early Readouts to Mediate Featural Bias in Distillation\u201d, we show that making predictions from early layers of a deep network (referred to as \u201cearly readouts\u201d) can automatically signal issues with the quality of the learned representations. In particular, these predictions are more often wrong, and more confidently wrong, when the network is relying on spurious features. We use this erroneous confidence to improve outcomes in model distillation, a setting where a larger \u201cteacher\u201d model guides the training of a smaller \u201cstudent\u201d model. Then in \u201cOvercoming Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks using a Feature Sieve\u201d, we intervene directly on these indicator signals by making the network \u201cforget\u201d the problematic features and consequently look for better, more predictive features. This substantially improves the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen domains compared to previous approaches. Our AI Principles and our Responsible AI practices guide how we research and develop these advanced applications and help us address the challenges posed by statistical biases. Animation comparing hypothetical responses from two models trained with and without the feature sieve. Early readouts for debiasing distillation We first illustrate the diagnostic value of early readouts and their application in debiased distillation, i.e., making sure that the student model inherits the teacher model\u2019s resilience to feature bias through distillation. We start with a standard distillation framework where the student is trained with a mixture of label matching (minimizing the cross-entropy loss between student outputs and the ground-truth labels) and teacher matching (minimizing the KL divergence loss between student and teacher outputs for any given input). Suppose one trains a linear decoder, i.e., a small auxiliary neural network named as Aux, on top of an intermediate representation of the student model. We refer to the output of this linear decoder as an early readout of the network representation. Our finding is that early readouts make more errors on instances that contain spurious features, and further, the confidence on those errors is higher than the confidence associated with other errors. This suggests that confidence on errors from early readouts is a fairly strong, automated indicator of the model\u2019s dependence on potentially spurious features. Illustrating the usage of early readouts (i.e., output from the auxiliary layer) in debiasing distillation. Instances that are confidently mispredicted in the early readouts are upweighted in the distillation loss. We used this signal to modulate the contribution of the teacher in the distillation loss on a per-instance basis, and found significant improvements in the trained student model as a result. We evaluated our approach on standard benchmark datasets known to contain spurious correlations (Waterbirds, CelebA, CivilComments, MNLI). Each of these datasets contain groupings of data that share an attribute potentially correlated with the label in a spurious manner. As an example, the CelebA dataset mentioned above includes groups such as {blond male, blond female, non-blond male, non-blond female}, with models typically performing the worst on the {non-blond female} group when predicting hair color. Thus, a measure of model performance is its worst group accuracy, i.e., the lowest accuracy among all known groups present in the dataset. We improved the worst group accuracy of student models on all datasets; moreover, we also improved overall accuracy in three of the four datasets, showing that our improvement on any one group does not come at the expense of accuracy on other groups. More details are available in our paper. Comparison of Worst Group Accuracies of different distillation techniques relative to that of the Teacher model. Our method outperforms other methods on all datasets. Overcoming simplicity bias with a feature sieve In a second, closely related project, we intervene directly on the information provided by early readouts, to improve feature learning and generalization. The workflow alternates between identifying problematic features and erasing identified features from the network. Our primary hypothesis is that early features are more prone to simplicity bias, and that by erasing (\u201csieving\u201d) these features, we allow richer feature representations to be learned. Training workflow with feature sieve. We alternate between identifying problematic features (using training iteration) and erasing them from the network (using forgetting iteration). We describe the identification and erasure steps in more detail: Identifying simple features: We train the primary model and the readout model (AUX above) in conventional fashion via forward- and back-propagation. Note that feedback from the auxiliary layer does not back-propagate to the main network. This is to force the auxiliary layer to learn from already-available features rather than create or reinforce them in the main network. Applying the feature sieve: We aim to erase the identified features in the early layers of the neural network with the use of a novel forgetting loss, Lf , which is simply the cross-entropy between the readout and a uniform distribution over labels. Essentially, all information that leads to nontrivial readouts are erased from the primary network. In this step, the auxiliary network and upper layers of the main network are kept unchanged. We can control specifically how the feature sieve is applied to a given dataset through a small number of configuration parameters. By changing the position and complexity of the auxiliary network, we control the complexity of the identified- and erased features. By modifying the mixing of learning and forgetting steps, we control the degree to which the model is challenged to learn more complex features. These choices, which are dataset-dependent, are made via hyperparameter search to maximize validation accuracy, a standard measure of generalization. Since we include \u201cno-forgetting\u201d (i.e., the baseline model) in the search space, we expect to find settings that are at least as good as the baseline. Below we show features learned by the baseline model (middle row) and our model (bottom row) on two benchmark datasets \u2014 biased activity recognition (BAR) and animal categorization (NICO). Feature importance was estimated using post-hoc gradient-based importance scoring (GRAD-CAM), with the orange-red end of the spectrum indicating high importance, while green-blue indicates low importance. Shown below, our trained models focus on the primary object of interest, whereas the baseline model tends to focus on background features that are simpler and spuriously correlated with the label. Feature importance scoring using GRAD-CAM on activity recognition (BAR) and animal categorization (NICO) generalization benchmarks. Our approach (last row) focuses on the relevant objects in the image, whereas the baseline (ERM; middle row) relies on background features that are spuriously correlated with the label. Through this ability to learn better, generalizable features, we show substantial gains over a range of relevant baselines on real-world spurious feature benchmark datasets: BAR, CelebA Hair, NICO and ImagenetA, by margins up to 11% (see figure below). More details are available in our paper. Our feature sieve method improves accuracy by significant margins relative to the nearest baseline for a range of feature generalization benchmark datasets. Conclusion We hope that our work on early readouts and their use in feature sieving for generalization will both spur the development of a new class of adversarial feature learning approaches and help improve the generalization capability and robustness of deep learning systems.

For example, in the <a href=\"https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html\">CELEBA</a> celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting \u201cblond\u201d as the hair color for most female faces \u2014 here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362524426_Addressing_fairness_in_artificial_intelligence_for_medical_imaging\">medical diagnosis</a>. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<p>\nSurprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to <em>amplify such statistical biases</em>, through the so-called <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf\">simplicity bias</a> of deep learning. This bias is the tendency of deep networks to identify weakly predictive features early in the training, and continue to anchor on these features, failing to identify more complex and potentially more accurate features. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith the above in mind, we propose simple and effective fixes to this dual challenge of spurious features and simplicity bias by applying <em>early readouts</em> and <em>feature forgetting</em>. First, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18590\">Using Early Readouts to Mediate Featural Bias in Distillation</a>\u201d, we show that making predictions from early layers of a deep network (referred to as \u201cearly readouts\u201d) can automatically signal issues with the quality of the learned representations. In particular, these predictions are more often wrong, and more confidently wrong, when the network is relying on spurious features. We use this erroneous confidence to improve outcomes in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf\">model distillation</a>, a setting where a larger \u201cteacher\u201d model guides the training of a smaller \u201cstudent\u201d model. Then in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13293\">Overcoming Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks using a Feature Sieve</a>\u201d, we intervene directly on these indicator signals by making the network \u201cforget\u201d the problematic features and consequently look for better, more predictive features. This substantially improves the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen domains compared to previous approaches. Our <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/principles\">AI Principles</a> and our <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/\">Responsible AI practices</a> guide how we research and develop these advanced applications and help us address the challenges posed by statistical biases.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzG_p8Re7HHeTp_Qg_GwjX5LcHsE-TZDmHr3azTSOLKl4f1J4xcL9vxo46zicAl6QoIKIrTJaI2Z51iFq2oICjeb6Ut4-W1W74bytv87pH3hKVJOotWWWDk0gwB-ak_YZRmtZyimw8b9lSJ1DRzh6uIpvIBN2pbIw-6MuN47rUjTK_RzLLfYXPrIjtpjRz/s1080/image3.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzG_p8Re7HHeTp_Qg_GwjX5LcHsE-TZDmHr3azTSOLKl4f1J4xcL9vxo46zicAl6QoIKIrTJaI2Z51iFq2oICjeb6Ut4-W1W74bytv87pH3hKVJOotWWWDk0gwB-ak_YZRmtZyimw8b9lSJ1DRzh6uIpvIBN2pbIw-6MuN47rUjTK_RzLLfYXPrIjtpjRz/s16000/image3.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Animation comparing hypothetical responses from two models trained with and without the feature sieve.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Early readouts for debiasing distillation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe first illustrate the diagnostic value of <em>early readouts</em> and their application in debiased distillation, i.e., making sure that the student model inherits the teacher model\u2019s resilience to feature bias through distillation. We start with a standard distillation framework where the student is trained with a mixture of label matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-entropy-loss-function-f38c4ec8643e\">cross-entropy loss</a> between student outputs and the ground-truth labels) and teacher matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">KL divergence</a> loss between student and teacher outputs for any given input). \n</p>\n<p>\nSuppose one trains a linear decoder, i.e., a small auxiliary neural network named as <em>Aux,</em> on top of an intermediate representation of the student model. We refer to the output of this linear decoder as an early readout of the network representation. Our finding is that early readouts make more errors on instances that contain spurious features, and further, the confidence on those errors is higher than the confidence associated with other errors. This suggests that confidence on errors from early readouts is a fairly strong, automated indicator of the model\u2019s dependence on potentially spurious features.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s1128/image5.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s16000/image5.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustrating the usage of early readouts (i.e., output from the auxiliary layer) in debiasing distillation.

For example, in the <a href=\"https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html\">CELEBA</a> celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting \u201cblond\u201d as the hair color for most female faces \u2014 here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362524426_Addressing_fairness_in_artificial_intelligence_for_medical_imaging\">medical diagnosis</a>. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<p>\nSurprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to <em>amplify such statistical biases</em>, through the so-called <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf\">simplicity bias</a> of deep learning. This bias is the tendency of deep networks to identify weakly predictive features early in the training, and continue to anchor on these features, failing to identify more complex and potentially more accurate features. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith the above in mind, we propose simple and effective fixes to this dual challenge of spurious features and simplicity bias by applying <em>early readouts</em> and <em>feature forgetting</em>. First, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18590\">Using Early Readouts to Mediate Featural Bias in Distillation</a>\u201d, we show that making predictions from early layers of a deep network (referred to as \u201cearly readouts\u201d) can automatically signal issues with the quality of the learned representations. In particular, these predictions are more often wrong, and more confidently wrong, when the network is relying on spurious features. We use this erroneous confidence to improve outcomes in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf\">model distillation</a>, a setting where a larger \u201cteacher\u201d model guides the training of a smaller \u201cstudent\u201d model. Then in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13293\">Overcoming Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks using a Feature Sieve</a>\u201d, we intervene directly on these indicator signals by making the network \u201cforget\u201d the problematic features and consequently look for better, more predictive features. This substantially improves the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen domains compared to previous approaches. Our <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/principles\">AI Principles</a> and our <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/\">Responsible AI practices</a> guide how we research and develop these advanced applications and help us address the challenges posed by statistical biases.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzG_p8Re7HHeTp_Qg_GwjX5LcHsE-TZDmHr3azTSOLKl4f1J4xcL9vxo46zicAl6QoIKIrTJaI2Z51iFq2oICjeb6Ut4-W1W74bytv87pH3hKVJOotWWWDk0gwB-ak_YZRmtZyimw8b9lSJ1DRzh6uIpvIBN2pbIw-6MuN47rUjTK_RzLLfYXPrIjtpjRz/s1080/image3.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzG_p8Re7HHeTp_Qg_GwjX5LcHsE-TZDmHr3azTSOLKl4f1J4xcL9vxo46zicAl6QoIKIrTJaI2Z51iFq2oICjeb6Ut4-W1W74bytv87pH3hKVJOotWWWDk0gwB-ak_YZRmtZyimw8b9lSJ1DRzh6uIpvIBN2pbIw-6MuN47rUjTK_RzLLfYXPrIjtpjRz/s16000/image3.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Animation comparing hypothetical responses from two models trained with and without the feature sieve.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Early readouts for debiasing distillation</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe first illustrate the diagnostic value of <em>early readouts</em> and their application in debiased distillation, i.e., making sure that the student model inherits the teacher model\u2019s resilience to feature bias through distillation. We start with a standard distillation framework where the student is trained with a mixture of label matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-entropy-loss-function-f38c4ec8643e\">cross-entropy loss</a> between student outputs and the ground-truth labels) and teacher matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">KL divergence</a> loss between student and teacher outputs for any given input). \n</p>\n<p>\nSuppose one trains a linear decoder, i.e., a small auxiliary neural network named as <em>Aux,</em> on top of an intermediate representation of the student model. We refer to the output of this linear decoder as an early readout of the network representation. Our finding is that early readouts make more errors on instances that contain spurious features, and further, the confidence on those errors is higher than the confidence associated with other errors. This suggests that confidence on errors from early readouts is a fairly strong, automated indicator of the model\u2019s dependence on potentially spurious features.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s1128/image5.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s16000/image5.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustrating the usage of early readouts (i.e., output from the auxiliary layer) in debiasing distillation.

Each of these datasets contain groupings of data that share an attribute potentially correlated with the label in a spurious manner. As an example, the CelebA dataset mentioned above includes groups such as {blond male, blond female, non-blond male, non-blond female}, with models typically performing the worst on the {non-blond female} group when predicting hair color. Thus, a measure of model performance is its <em>worst group accuracy</em>, i.e., the lowest accuracy among all known groups present in the dataset. We improved the worst group accuracy of student models on all datasets; moreover, we also improved overall accuracy in three of the four datasets, showing that our improvement on any one group does not come at the expense of accuracy on other groups.

Essentially, all information that leads to nontrivial readouts are erased from the primary network. In this step, the auxiliary network and upper layers of the main network are kept unchanged.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe can control specifically how the feature sieve is applied to a given dataset through a small number of configuration parameters.

For example, in the <a href=\"https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html\">CELEBA</a> celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting \u201cblond\u201d as the hair color for most female faces \u2014 here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362524426_Addressing_fairness_in_artificial_intelligence_for_medical_imaging\">medical diagnosis</a>. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<p>\nSurprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to <em>amplify such statistical biases</em>, through the so-called <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf\">simplicity bias</a> of deep learning. This bias is the tendency of deep networks to identify weakly predictive features early in the training, and continue to anchor on these features, failing to identify more complex and potentially more accurate features. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith the above in mind, we propose simple and effective fixes to this dual challenge of spurious features and simplicity bias by applying <em>early readouts</em> and <em>feature forgetting</em>. First, in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18590\">Using Early Readouts to Mediate Featural Bias in Distillation</a>\u201d, we show that making predictions from early layers of a deep network (referred to as \u201cearly readouts\u201d) can automatically signal issues with the quality of the learned representations. In particular, these predictions are more often wrong, and more confidently wrong, when the network is relying on spurious features. We use this erroneous confidence to improve outcomes in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf\">model distillation</a>, a setting where a larger \u201cteacher\u201d model guides the training of a smaller \u201cstudent\u201d model. Then in \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13293\">Overcoming Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks using a Feature Sieve</a>\u201d, we intervene directly on these indicator signals by making the network \u201cforget\u201d the problematic features and consequently look for better, more predictive features. This substantially improves the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen domains compared to previous approaches.

We start with a standard distillation framework where the student is trained with a mixture of label matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-entropy-loss-function-f38c4ec8643e\">cross-entropy loss</a> between student outputs and the ground-truth labels) and teacher matching (minimizing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">KL divergence</a> loss between student and teacher outputs for any given input). \n</p>\n<p>\nSuppose one trains a linear decoder, i.e., a small auxiliary neural network named as <em>Aux,</em> on top of an intermediate representation of the student model. We refer to the output of this linear decoder as an early readout of the network representation. Our finding is that early readouts make more errors on instances that contain spurious features, and further, the confidence on those errors is higher than the confidence associated with other errors. This suggests that confidence on errors from early readouts is a fairly strong, automated indicator of the model\u2019s dependence on potentially spurious features.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s1128/image5.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixpq4OhPGxL9gGW30-0kqQ_CieDj3PJcqw8L4_7fBDZOFKuQpI67ljqIItOoJ3U9-dpPd1CpofAG_ld689r0HcPTrzFeTd1ceMQ42C3CRPWWJMYknydHpJhFjQUjb-M6mx8ILQbWEBIOv-NSgTauMGgDZ8t3EMGHE3j6UN9HIF3BJmB63GhOzFwOVmswlc/s16000/image5.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustrating the usage of early readouts (i.e., output from the auxiliary layer) in debiasing distillation.

Thus, a measure of model performance is its <em>worst group accuracy</em>, i.e., the lowest accuracy among all known groups present in the dataset. We improved the worst group accuracy of student models on all datasets; moreover, we also improved overall accuracy in three of the four datasets, showing that our improvement on any one group does not come at the expense of accuracy on other groups.

Note that feedback from the auxiliary layer does not back-propagate to the main network. This is to force the auxiliary layer to learn from already-available features rather than create or reinforce them in the main network. \n\n</li><li><b>Applying the feature sieve</b>: We aim to erase the identified features in the early layers of the neural network with the use of a novel <em>forgetting loss</em>,<em> L<sub>f </sub></em>, which is simply the cross-entropy between the readout and a uniform distribution over labels. Essentially, all information that leads to nontrivial readouts are erased from the primary network. In this step, the auxiliary network and upper layers of the main network are kept unchanged.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe can control specifically how the feature sieve is applied to a given dataset through a small number of configuration parameters. By changing the position and complexity of the auxiliary network, we control the complexity of the identified- and erased features. By modifying the mixing of learning and forgetting steps, we control the degree to which the model is challenged to learn more complex features. These choices, which are dataset-dependent, are made via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization\">hyperparameter search</a> to maximize validation accuracy, a  standard measure of generalization.

      "summary": "MobileDiffusion introduces an approach for subsecond text-to-image generation directly on mobile devices.",
      "summary_original": "Posted by Yang Zhao, Senior Software Engineer, and Tingbo Hou, Senior Staff Software Engineer, Core ML Text-to-image diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL\u00b7E, and Imagen). While recent advancements in inference solutions on Android via MediaPipe and iOS via Core ML have been made in the past year, rapid (sub-second) text-to-image generation on mobile devices has remained out of reach. To that end, in \u201cMobileDiffusion: Subsecond Text-to-Image Generation on Mobile Devices\u201d, we introduce a novel approach with the potential for rapid text-to-image generation on-device. MobileDiffusion is an efficient latent diffusion model specifically designed for mobile devices. We also adopt DiffusionGAN to achieve one-step sampling during inference, which fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model while leveraging a GAN to model the denoising step. We have tested MobileDiffusion on iOS and Android premium devices, and it can run in half a second to generate a 512x512 high-quality image. Its comparably small model size of just 520M parameters makes it uniquely suited for mobile deployment. Rapid text-to-image generation on-device. Background The relative inefficiency of text-to-image diffusion models arises from two primary challenges. First, the inherent design of diffusion models requires iterative denoising to generate images, necessitating multiple evaluations of the model. Second, the complexity of the network architecture in text-to-image diffusion models involves a substantial number of parameters, regularly reaching into the billions and resulting in computationally expensive evaluations. As a result, despite the potential benefits of deploying generative models on mobile devices, such as enhancing user experience and addressing emerging privacy concerns, it remains relatively unexplored within the current literature. The optimization of inference efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models has been an active research area. Previous studies predominantly concentrate on addressing the first challenge, seeking to reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Leveraging advanced numerical solvers (e.g., DPM) or distillation techniques (e.g., progressive distillation, consistency distillation), the number of necessary sampling steps have significantly reduced from several hundreds to single digits. Some recent techniques, like DiffusionGAN and Adversarial Diffusion Distillation, even reduce to a single necessary step. However, on mobile devices, even a small number of evaluation steps can be slow due to the complexity of model architecture. Thus far, the architectural efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models has received comparatively less attention. A handful of earlier works briefly touches upon this matter, involving the removal of redundant neural network blocks (e.g., SnapFusion). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive analysis of each component within the model architecture, thereby falling short of providing a holistic guide for designing highly efficient architectures. MobileDiffusion Effectively overcoming the challenges imposed by the limited computational power of mobile devices requires an in-depth and holistic exploration of the model's architectural efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, our research undertakes a detailed examination of each constituent and computational operation within Stable Diffusion\u2019s UNet architecture. We present a comprehensive guide for crafting highly efficient text-to-image diffusion models culminating in the MobileDiffusion. The design of MobileDiffusion follows that of latent diffusion models. It contains three components: a text encoder, a diffusion UNet, and an image decoder. For the text encoder, we use CLIP-ViT/L14, which is a small model (125M parameters) suitable for mobile. We then turn our focus to the diffusion UNet and image decoder. Diffusion UNet As illustrated in the figure below, diffusion UNets commonly interleave transformer blocks and convolution blocks. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of these two fundamental building blocks. Throughout the study, we control the training pipeline (e.g., data, optimizer) to study the effects of different architectures. In classic text-to-image diffusion models, a transformer block consists of a self-attention layer (SA) for modeling long-range dependencies among visual features, a cross-attention layer (CA) to capture interactions between text conditioning and visual features, and a feed-forward layer (FF) to post-process the output of attention layers. These transformer blocks hold a pivotal role in text-to-image diffusion models, serving as the primary components responsible for text comprehension. However, they also pose a significant efficiency challenge, given the computational expense of the attention operation, which is quadratic to the sequence length. We follow the idea of UViT architecture, which places more transformer blocks at the bottleneck of the UNet. This design choice is motivated by the fact that the attention computation is less resource-intensive at the bottleneck due to its lower dimensionality. Our UNet architecture incorporates more transformers in the middle, and skips self-attention (SA) layers at higher resolutions. Convolution blocks, in particular ResNet blocks, are deployed at each level of the UNet. While these blocks are instrumental for feature extraction and information flow, the associated computational costs, especially at high-resolution levels, can be substantial. One proven approach in this context is separable convolution. We observed that replacing regular convolution layers with lightweight separable convolution layers in the deeper segments of the UNet yields similar performance. In the figure below, we compare the UNets of several diffusion models. Our MobileDiffusion exhibits superior efficiency in terms of FLOPs (floating-point operations) and number of parameters. Comparison of some diffusion UNets. Image decoder In addition to the UNet, we also optimized the image decoder. We trained a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode an RGB image to an 8-channel latent variable, with 8\u00d7 smaller spatial size of the image. A latent variable can be decoded to an image and gets 8\u00d7 larger in size. To further enhance efficiency, we design a lightweight decoder architecture by pruning the original\u2019s width and depth. The resulting lightweight decoder leads to a significant performance boost, with nearly 50% latency improvement and better quality. For more details, please refer to our paper. VAE reconstruction. Our VAE decoders have better visual quality than SD (Stable Diffusion). Decoder #Params (M) PSNR\u2191 SSIM\u2191 LPIPS\u2193 SD 49.5 26.7 0.76 0.037 Ours 39.3 30.0 0.83 0.032 Ours-Lite 9.8 30.2 0.84 0.032 Quality evaluation of VAE decoders. Our lite decoder is much smaller than SD, with better quality metrics, including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). One-step sampling In addition to optimizing the model architecture, we adopt a DiffusionGAN hybrid to achieve one-step sampling. Training DiffusionGAN hybrid models for text-to-image generation encounters several intricacies. Notably, the discriminator, a classifier distinguishing real data and generated data, must make judgments based on both texture and semantics. Moreover, the cost of training text-to-image models can be extremely high, particularly in the case of GAN-based models, where the discriminator introduces additional parameters. Purely GAN-based text-to-image models (e.g., StyleGAN-T, GigaGAN) confront similar complexities, resulting in highly intricate and expensive training. To overcome these challenges, we use a pre-trained diffusion UNet to initialize the generator and discriminator. This design enables seamless initialization with the pre-trained diffusion model. We postulate that the internal features within the diffusion model contain rich information of the intricate interplay between textual and visual data. This initialization strategy significantly streamlines the training. The figure below illustrates the training procedure. After initialization, a noisy image is sent to the generator for one-step diffusion. The result is evaluated against ground truth with a reconstruction loss, similar to diffusion model training. We then add noise to the output and send it to the discriminator, whose result is evaluated with a GAN loss, effectively adopting the GAN to model a denoising step. By using pre-trained weights to initialize the generator and the discriminator, the training becomes a fine-tuning process, which converges in less than 10K iterations.

However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., <a href=\"https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-public-release\">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/dall-e\">DALL\u00b7E</a>, and <a href=\"https://imagen.research.google/\">Imagen</a>).

First, the inherent design of diffusion models requires <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/06/on-device-diffusion-plugins-for.html\">iterative denoising</a> to generate images, necessitating multiple evaluations of the model. Second, the complexity of the network architecture in text-to-image diffusion models involves a substantial number of parameters, regularly reaching into the billions and resulting in computationally expensive evaluations. As a result, despite the potential benefits of deploying generative models on mobile devices, such as enhancing user experience and addressing emerging privacy concerns, it remains relatively unexplored within the current literature.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe optimization of inference efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models has been an active research area. Previous studies predominantly concentrate on addressing the first challenge, seeking to reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Leveraging advanced numerical solvers (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927\">DPM</a>) or distillation techniques (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512\">progressive distillation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469\">consistency distillation</a>), the number of necessary sampling steps have significantly reduced from several hundreds to single digits. Some recent techniques, like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09257\">DiffusionGAN</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17042#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Adversarial%20Diffusion%20Distillation,while%20maintaining%20high%20image%20quality.\">Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</a>, even reduce to a single necessary step. \n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, on mobile devices, even a small number of evaluation steps can be slow due to the complexity of model architecture. Thus far, the architectural efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models has received comparatively less attention. A handful of earlier works briefly touches upon this matter, involving the removal of redundant neural network blocks (e.g., <a href=\"https://snap-research.github.io/SnapFusion/\">SnapFusion</a>). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive analysis of each component within the model architecture, thereby falling short of providing a holistic guide for designing highly efficient architectures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>MobileDiffusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEffectively overcoming the challenges imposed by the limited computational power of mobile devices requires an in-depth and holistic exploration of the model's architectural efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, our research undertakes a detailed examination of each constituent and computational operation within Stable Diffusion\u2019s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">UNet architecture</a>. We present a comprehensive guide for crafting highly efficient text-to-image diffusion models culminating in the MobileDiffusion.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe design of MobileDiffusion follows that of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">latent diffusion models</a>. It contains three components: a text encoder, a diffusion UNet, and an image decoder. For the text encoder, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020\">CLIP-ViT/L14</a>, which is a small model (125M parameters) suitable for mobile. We then turn our focus to the diffusion UNet and image decoder. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Diffusion UNet</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAs illustrated in the figure below, diffusion UNets commonly interleave transformer blocks and convolution blocks. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of these two fundamental building blocks. Throughout the study, we control the training pipeline (e.g., data, optimizer) to study the effects of different architectures.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn classic text-to-image diffusion models, a transformer block consists of a self-attention layer (SA) for modeling long-range dependencies among visual features, a cross-attention layer (CA) to capture interactions between text conditioning and visual features, and a feed-forward layer (FF) to post-process the output of attention layers. These transformer blocks hold a pivotal role in text-to-image diffusion models, serving as the primary components responsible for text comprehension. However, they also pose a significant efficiency challenge, given the computational expense of the attention operation, which is quadratic to the sequence length. We follow the idea of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11093\">UViT</a> architecture, which places more transformer blocks at the bottleneck of the UNet. This design choice is motivated by the fact that the attention computation is less resource-intensive at the bottleneck due to its lower dimensionality. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s915/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our UNet architecture incorporates more transformers in the middle, and skips self-attention (SA) layers at higher resolutions.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nConvolution blocks, in particular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">ResNet</a> blocks, are deployed at each level of the UNet. While these blocks are instrumental for feature extraction and information flow, the associated computational costs, especially at high-resolution levels, can be substantial. One proven approach in this context is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861\">separable convolution</a>. We observed that replacing regular convolution layers with lightweight separable convolution layers in the deeper segments of the UNet yields similar performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the figure below, we compare the UNets of several diffusion models.

We trained a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03715\">variational autoencoder</a> (VAE) to encode an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\">RGB</a> image to an 8-channel latent variable, with 8\u00d7 smaller spatial size of the image. A latent variable can be decoded to an image and gets 8\u00d7 larger in size.  To further enhance efficiency, we design a lightweight decoder architecture by pruning the original\u2019s width and depth. The resulting lightweight decoder leads to a significant performance boost, with nearly 50% latency improvement and better quality.

Training DiffusionGAN hybrid models for text-to-image generation encounters several intricacies. Notably, the discriminator, a classifier distinguishing real data and generated data, must make judgments based on both texture and semantics. Moreover, the cost of training text-to-image models can be extremely high, particularly in the case of GAN-based models, where the discriminator introduces additional parameters. Purely GAN-based text-to-image models (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09515\">StyleGAN-T</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511\">GigaGAN</a>) confront similar complexities, resulting in highly intricate and expensive training.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo overcome these challenges, we use a pre-trained diffusion UNet to initialize the generator and discriminator. This design enables seamless initialization with the pre-trained diffusion model. We postulate that the internal features within the diffusion model contain rich information of the intricate interplay between textual and visual data. This initialization strategy significantly streamlines the training.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe figure below illustrates the training procedure. After initialization, a noisy image is sent to the generator for one-step diffusion. The result is evaluated against ground truth with a reconstruction loss, similar to diffusion model training. We then add noise to the output and send it to the discriminator, whose result is evaluated with a GAN loss, effectively adopting the GAN to model a denoising step. By using pre-trained weights to initialize the generator and the discriminator, the training becomes a fine-tuning process, which converges in less than 10K iterations.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s960/image7.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s16000/image7.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of DiffusionGAN fine-tuning.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nBelow we show example images generated by our MobileDiffusion with DiffusionGAN one-step sampling.

However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., <a href=\"https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-public-release\">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/dall-e\">DALL\u00b7E</a>, and <a href=\"https://imagen.research.google/\">Imagen</a>).

First, the inherent design of diffusion models requires <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/06/on-device-diffusion-plugins-for.html\">iterative denoising</a> to generate images, necessitating multiple evaluations of the model. Second, the complexity of the network architecture in text-to-image diffusion models involves a substantial number of parameters, regularly reaching into the billions and resulting in computationally expensive evaluations. As a result, despite the potential benefits of deploying generative models on mobile devices, such as enhancing user experience and addressing emerging privacy concerns, it remains relatively unexplored within the current literature.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe optimization of inference efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models has been an active research area. Previous studies predominantly concentrate on addressing the first challenge, seeking to reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Leveraging advanced numerical solvers (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927\">DPM</a>) or distillation techniques (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512\">progressive distillation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469\">consistency distillation</a>), the number of necessary sampling steps have significantly reduced from several hundreds to single digits. Some recent techniques, like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09257\">DiffusionGAN</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17042#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Adversarial%20Diffusion%20Distillation,while%20maintaining%20high%20image%20quality.\">Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</a>, even reduce to a single necessary step. \n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, on mobile devices, even a small number of evaluation steps can be slow due to the complexity of model architecture. Thus far, the architectural efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models has received comparatively less attention. A handful of earlier works briefly touches upon this matter, involving the removal of redundant neural network blocks (e.g., <a href=\"https://snap-research.github.io/SnapFusion/\">SnapFusion</a>). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive analysis of each component within the model architecture, thereby falling short of providing a holistic guide for designing highly efficient architectures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>MobileDiffusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEffectively overcoming the challenges imposed by the limited computational power of mobile devices requires an in-depth and holistic exploration of the model's architectural efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, our research undertakes a detailed examination of each constituent and computational operation within Stable Diffusion\u2019s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">UNet architecture</a>. We present a comprehensive guide for crafting highly efficient text-to-image diffusion models culminating in the MobileDiffusion.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe design of MobileDiffusion follows that of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">latent diffusion models</a>. It contains three components: a text encoder, a diffusion UNet, and an image decoder. For the text encoder, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020\">CLIP-ViT/L14</a>, which is a small model (125M parameters) suitable for mobile. We then turn our focus to the diffusion UNet and image decoder. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Diffusion UNet</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAs illustrated in the figure below, diffusion UNets commonly interleave transformer blocks and convolution blocks. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of these two fundamental building blocks. Throughout the study, we control the training pipeline (e.g., data, optimizer) to study the effects of different architectures.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn classic text-to-image diffusion models, a transformer block consists of a self-attention layer (SA) for modeling long-range dependencies among visual features, a cross-attention layer (CA) to capture interactions between text conditioning and visual features, and a feed-forward layer (FF) to post-process the output of attention layers. These transformer blocks hold a pivotal role in text-to-image diffusion models, serving as the primary components responsible for text comprehension. However, they also pose a significant efficiency challenge, given the computational expense of the attention operation, which is quadratic to the sequence length. We follow the idea of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11093\">UViT</a> architecture, which places more transformer blocks at the bottleneck of the UNet. This design choice is motivated by the fact that the attention computation is less resource-intensive at the bottleneck due to its lower dimensionality. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s915/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our UNet architecture incorporates more transformers in the middle, and skips self-attention (SA) layers at higher resolutions.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nConvolution blocks, in particular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">ResNet</a> blocks, are deployed at each level of the UNet. While these blocks are instrumental for feature extraction and information flow, the associated computational costs, especially at high-resolution levels, can be substantial. One proven approach in this context is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861\">separable convolution</a>. We observed that replacing regular convolution layers with lightweight separable convolution layers in the deeper segments of the UNet yields similar performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the figure below, we compare the UNets of several diffusion models.

We trained a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03715\">variational autoencoder</a> (VAE) to encode an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\">RGB</a> image to an 8-channel latent variable, with 8\u00d7 smaller spatial size of the image. A latent variable can be decoded to an image and gets 8\u00d7 larger in size.  To further enhance efficiency, we design a lightweight decoder architecture by pruning the original\u2019s width and depth. The resulting lightweight decoder leads to a significant performance boost, with nearly 50% latency improvement and better quality.

Training DiffusionGAN hybrid models for text-to-image generation encounters several intricacies. Notably, the discriminator, a classifier distinguishing real data and generated data, must make judgments based on both texture and semantics. Moreover, the cost of training text-to-image models can be extremely high, particularly in the case of GAN-based models, where the discriminator introduces additional parameters. Purely GAN-based text-to-image models (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09515\">StyleGAN-T</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511\">GigaGAN</a>) confront similar complexities, resulting in highly intricate and expensive training.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo overcome these challenges, we use a pre-trained diffusion UNet to initialize the generator and discriminator. This design enables seamless initialization with the pre-trained diffusion model. We postulate that the internal features within the diffusion model contain rich information of the intricate interplay between textual and visual data. This initialization strategy significantly streamlines the training.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe figure below illustrates the training procedure. After initialization, a noisy image is sent to the generator for one-step diffusion. The result is evaluated against ground truth with a reconstruction loss, similar to diffusion model training. We then add noise to the output and send it to the discriminator, whose result is evaluated with a GAN loss, effectively adopting the GAN to model a denoising step. By using pre-trained weights to initialize the generator and the discriminator, the training becomes a fine-tuning process, which converges in less than 10K iterations.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s960/image7.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s16000/image7.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of DiffusionGAN fine-tuning.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nBelow we show example images generated by our MobileDiffusion with DiffusionGAN one-step sampling.

First, the inherent design of diffusion models requires <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/06/on-device-diffusion-plugins-for.html\">iterative denoising</a> to generate images, necessitating multiple evaluations of the model. Second, the complexity of the network architecture in text-to-image diffusion models involves a substantial number of parameters, regularly reaching into the billions and resulting in computationally expensive evaluations. As a result, despite the potential benefits of deploying generative models on mobile devices, such as enhancing user experience and addressing emerging privacy concerns, it remains relatively unexplored within the current literature.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe optimization of inference efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models has been an active research area. Previous studies predominantly concentrate on addressing the first challenge, seeking to reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Leveraging advanced numerical solvers (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927\">DPM</a>) or distillation techniques (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512\">progressive distillation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469\">consistency distillation</a>), the number of necessary sampling steps have significantly reduced from several hundreds to single digits. Some recent techniques, like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09257\">DiffusionGAN</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17042#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Adversarial%20Diffusion%20Distillation,while%20maintaining%20high%20image%20quality.\">Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</a>, even reduce to a single necessary step. \n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, on mobile devices, even a small number of evaluation steps can be slow due to the complexity of model architecture. Thus far, the architectural efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models has received comparatively less attention. A handful of earlier works briefly touches upon this matter, involving the removal of redundant neural network blocks (e.g., <a href=\"https://snap-research.github.io/SnapFusion/\">SnapFusion</a>). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive analysis of each component within the model architecture, thereby falling short of providing a holistic guide for designing highly efficient architectures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>MobileDiffusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEffectively overcoming the challenges imposed by the limited computational power of mobile devices requires an in-depth and holistic exploration of the model's architectural efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, our research undertakes a detailed examination of each constituent and computational operation within Stable Diffusion\u2019s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">UNet architecture</a>. We present a comprehensive guide for crafting highly efficient text-to-image diffusion models culminating in the MobileDiffusion.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe design of MobileDiffusion follows that of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">latent diffusion models</a>. It contains three components: a text encoder, a diffusion UNet, and an image decoder. For the text encoder, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020\">CLIP-ViT/L14</a>, which is a small model (125M parameters) suitable for mobile. We then turn our focus to the diffusion UNet and image decoder. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Diffusion UNet</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAs illustrated in the figure below, diffusion UNets commonly interleave transformer blocks and convolution blocks. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of these two fundamental building blocks. Throughout the study, we control the training pipeline (e.g., data, optimizer) to study the effects of different architectures.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn classic text-to-image diffusion models, a transformer block consists of a self-attention layer (SA) for modeling long-range dependencies among visual features, a cross-attention layer (CA) to capture interactions between text conditioning and visual features, and a feed-forward layer (FF) to post-process the output of attention layers. These transformer blocks hold a pivotal role in text-to-image diffusion models, serving as the primary components responsible for text comprehension. However, they also pose a significant efficiency challenge, given the computational expense of the attention operation, which is quadratic to the sequence length. We follow the idea of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11093\">UViT</a> architecture, which places more transformer blocks at the bottleneck of the UNet. This design choice is motivated by the fact that the attention computation is less resource-intensive at the bottleneck due to its lower dimensionality. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s915/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our UNet architecture incorporates more transformers in the middle, and skips self-attention (SA) layers at higher resolutions.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nConvolution blocks, in particular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">ResNet</a> blocks, are deployed at each level of the UNet.

One proven approach in this context is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861\">separable convolution</a>.

A latent variable can be decoded to an image and gets 8\u00d7 larger in size.  To further enhance efficiency, we design a lightweight decoder architecture by pruning the original\u2019s width and depth. The resulting lightweight decoder leads to a significant performance boost, with nearly 50% latency improvement and better quality.

Training DiffusionGAN hybrid models for text-to-image generation encounters several intricacies. Notably, the discriminator, a classifier distinguishing real data and generated data, must make judgments based on both texture and semantics. Moreover, the cost of training text-to-image models can be extremely high, particularly in the case of GAN-based models, where the discriminator introduces additional parameters. Purely GAN-based text-to-image models (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09515\">StyleGAN-T</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511\">GigaGAN</a>) confront similar complexities, resulting in highly intricate and expensive training.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo overcome these challenges, we use a pre-trained diffusion UNet to initialize the generator and discriminator. This design enables seamless initialization with the pre-trained diffusion model. We postulate that the internal features within the diffusion model contain rich information of the intricate interplay between textual and visual data. This initialization strategy significantly streamlines the training.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe figure below illustrates the training procedure. After initialization, a noisy image is sent to the generator for one-step diffusion. The result is evaluated against ground truth with a reconstruction loss, similar to diffusion model training. We then add noise to the output and send it to the discriminator, whose result is evaluated with a GAN loss, effectively adopting the GAN to model a denoising step. By using pre-trained weights to initialize the generator and the discriminator, the training becomes a fine-tuning process, which converges in less than 10K iterations.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s960/image7.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s16000/image7.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of DiffusionGAN fine-tuning.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nBelow we show example images generated by our MobileDiffusion with DiffusionGAN one-step sampling.

First, the inherent design of diffusion models requires <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/06/on-device-diffusion-plugins-for.html\">iterative denoising</a> to generate images, necessitating multiple evaluations of the model. Second, the complexity of the network architecture in text-to-image diffusion models involves a substantial number of parameters, regularly reaching into the billions and resulting in computationally expensive evaluations. As a result, despite the potential benefits of deploying generative models on mobile devices, such as enhancing user experience and addressing emerging privacy concerns, it remains relatively unexplored within the current literature.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe optimization of inference efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models has been an active research area. Previous studies predominantly concentrate on addressing the first challenge, seeking to reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Leveraging advanced numerical solvers (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927\">DPM</a>) or distillation techniques (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512\">progressive distillation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469\">consistency distillation</a>), the number of necessary sampling steps have significantly reduced from several hundreds to single digits. Some recent techniques, like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09257\">DiffusionGAN</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17042#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Adversarial%20Diffusion%20Distillation,while%20maintaining%20high%20image%20quality.\">Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</a>, even reduce to a single necessary step. \n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, on mobile devices, even a small number of evaluation steps can be slow due to the complexity of model architecture. Thus far, the architectural efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models has received comparatively less attention. A handful of earlier works briefly touches upon this matter, involving the removal of redundant neural network blocks (e.g., <a href=\"https://snap-research.github.io/SnapFusion/\">SnapFusion</a>). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive analysis of each component within the model architecture, thereby falling short of providing a holistic guide for designing highly efficient architectures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>MobileDiffusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEffectively overcoming the challenges imposed by the limited computational power of mobile devices requires an in-depth and holistic exploration of the model's architectural efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, our research undertakes a detailed examination of each constituent and computational operation within Stable Diffusion\u2019s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">UNet architecture</a>. We present a comprehensive guide for crafting highly efficient text-to-image diffusion models culminating in the MobileDiffusion.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe design of MobileDiffusion follows that of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752\">latent diffusion models</a>. It contains three components: a text encoder, a diffusion UNet, and an image decoder. For the text encoder, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020\">CLIP-ViT/L14</a>, which is a small model (125M parameters) suitable for mobile. We then turn our focus to the diffusion UNet and image decoder. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Diffusion UNet</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAs illustrated in the figure below, diffusion UNets commonly interleave transformer blocks and convolution blocks. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of these two fundamental building blocks. Throughout the study, we control the training pipeline (e.g., data, optimizer) to study the effects of different architectures.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn classic text-to-image diffusion models, a transformer block consists of a self-attention layer (SA) for modeling long-range dependencies among visual features, a cross-attention layer (CA) to capture interactions between text conditioning and visual features, and a feed-forward layer (FF) to post-process the output of attention layers. These transformer blocks hold a pivotal role in text-to-image diffusion models, serving as the primary components responsible for text comprehension. However, they also pose a significant efficiency challenge, given the computational expense of the attention operation, which is quadratic to the sequence length. We follow the idea of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11093\">UViT</a> architecture, which places more transformer blocks at the bottleneck of the UNet. This design choice is motivated by the fact that the attention computation is less resource-intensive at the bottleneck due to its lower dimensionality. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s915/image4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsshK53k6noqIbabpGMBzYIBCdviXisDoBsD3Houk-lXzN8pZQcusKYBvjWwcwA1Aq5DnWyk01YM9B2RyRZx6HcGgTP-LrW-tnwFwByzlBACN3WggyPYM0Mpyr2OVGVLFhx1uN48aR1g9P4o0joN2STli9VpA_tFMdQ-ikRXVrNpawzB793-unSENR-PIV/s16000/image4.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our UNet architecture incorporates more transformers in the middle, and skips self-attention (SA) layers at higher resolutions.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nConvolution blocks, in particular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">ResNet</a> blocks, are deployed at each level of the UNet.

One proven approach in this context is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861\">separable convolution</a>.

A latent variable can be decoded to an image and gets 8\u00d7 larger in size.  To further enhance efficiency, we design a lightweight decoder architecture by pruning the original\u2019s width and depth. The resulting lightweight decoder leads to a significant performance boost, with nearly 50% latency improvement and better quality.

Training DiffusionGAN hybrid models for text-to-image generation encounters several intricacies. Notably, the discriminator, a classifier distinguishing real data and generated data, must make judgments based on both texture and semantics. Moreover, the cost of training text-to-image models can be extremely high, particularly in the case of GAN-based models, where the discriminator introduces additional parameters. Purely GAN-based text-to-image models (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09515\">StyleGAN-T</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511\">GigaGAN</a>) confront similar complexities, resulting in highly intricate and expensive training.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo overcome these challenges, we use a pre-trained diffusion UNet to initialize the generator and discriminator. This design enables seamless initialization with the pre-trained diffusion model. We postulate that the internal features within the diffusion model contain rich information of the intricate interplay between textual and visual data. This initialization strategy significantly streamlines the training.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe figure below illustrates the training procedure. After initialization, a noisy image is sent to the generator for one-step diffusion. The result is evaluated against ground truth with a reconstruction loss, similar to diffusion model training. We then add noise to the output and send it to the discriminator, whose result is evaluated with a GAN loss, effectively adopting the GAN to model a denoising step. By using pre-trained weights to initialize the generator and the discriminator, the training becomes a fine-tuning process, which converges in less than 10K iterations.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s960/image7.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK7SE2-cHSlP-PDmkl_xfjp3sP-kB41r6OvC8Wg6miXnYwdES0INwN19BHWQ_uyXtcBT-872U5J6jLY8yXVtA_W96qkRRPh6Pjvw0n-ZJvjJK91kYTh7H1n4nzy8z1TyrQZlZoZrQUDTo5Qm-6a_2vIVye3aqm7o32qOOXiWXwxDzw_J6cQsOrJ-UILKw/s16000/image7.jpg\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illustration of DiffusionGAN fine-tuning.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nBelow we show example images generated by our MobileDiffusion with DiffusionGAN one-step sampling.

The backbone of these applications lies in large language models (LLMs). LLMs are memory-intensive and typically require specialized hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver tens of exaflops of computing power. This blog post shows how we can start addressing the computational challenges by utilizing memory more effectively. The bulk of an LLM\u2019s memory and compute are consumed by weights in matrix multiplication operations. Using narrower data types reduces memory consumption. For example, storing weights in the 8-bit integer (i.e., U8 or S8) data type reduces the memory footprint by 4\u00d7 relative to single-precision (F32) and 2\u00d7 relative to half-precision (F16) or bfloat16 (BF16). Furthermore, previous work has shown that LLM models running matrix multiplications with weights in S8 and input in F16 (preserving higher precision of the user-input) is an effective method for increasing the efficiency with acceptable trade-offs in accuracy. This technique is known as weight-only quantization and requires efficient implementation of matrix multiplication with mixed-inputs, e.g., half-precision input multiplied with 8-bits integer. Hardware accelerators, including GPUs, support a fixed set of data types, and thus, mixed-input matrix multiplication requires software transformations to map to the hardware operations. To that end, in this blog we focus on mapping mixed-input matrix multiplication onto the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. We present software techniques addressing data type conversion and layout conformance to map mixed-input matrix multiplication efficiently onto hardware-supported data types and layouts. Our results show that the overhead of additional work in software is minimal and enables performance close to the peak hardware capabilities. The software techniques described here are released in the open-source NVIDIA/CUTLASS repository. Memory footprint for an 175B parameter LLM model with various data types formats. The matrix-multiply-accumulate operation Modern AI hardware accelerators such as Google\u2019s TPU and NVIDIA\u2019s GPU multiply matrices natively in the hardware by targeting Tensor Cores, which are specialized processing elements to accelerate matrix operations, particularly for AI workloads. In this blog, we focus on NVIDIA Ampere Tensor Cores, which provide the matrix-multiply-accumulate (mma) operation. For the rest of the blog the reference to mma is for Ampere Tensor Cores. The supported data types, shapes, and data layout of the two input matrices (called operands) for the mma operation are fixed in hardware. This means that matrix multiplications with various data types and larger shapes are implemented in the software by tiling the problem onto hardware-supported data types, shapes, and layouts. The Tensor Core mma operation is defined by specifying two input matrices (e.g., A & B, shown below) to produce a result matrix, C. The mma operation natively supports mixed-precision. Mixed-precision Tensor Cores allow mixing input (A and B) data type with the result (C) data type. In contrast, mixed-input matrix multiplication involves mixing the input data types, and it is not supported by the hardware, so it needs to be implemented in the software. Tensor Core operation of M-by-N-by-K on input matrix A of M-by-K and matrix B of K-by-N produces output matrix C of M-by-N. Challenges of mixed-input matrix multiplication To simplify the discussion, we restrict to a specific example of mixed-input matrix multiplication: F16 for user input and U8 for the model weights (written as F16 * U8). The techniques described here work for various combinations of mixed-input data types. A GPU programmer can access a hierarchy of memory, including global memory, shared memory, and registers, which are arranged in order of decreasing capacity but increasing speed. NVIDIA Ampere Tensor Core mma operations consume input matrices from registers. Furthermore, input and output matrices are required to conform to a layout of data within a group of 32 threads known as a warp. The supported data type and layout within a warp are fixed for an mma operation, so to implement mixed-input multiplication efficiently, it is necessary to solve the challenges of data type conversion and layout conformance in software. Data type conversion The mma operation requires two input matrices with the same data type. Thus, mixed-input matrix multiplication, where one of the operands is stored in U8 in global memory and other in F16, requires a data type conversion from U8 to F16. The conversion will bring two operands to F16, mapping the mixed-input matrix multiplication to hardware-supported mixed-precision Tensor Cores. Given the large number of weights, there are a large number of such operations, and our techniques show how to reduce their latency and improve performance. Layout conformance The mma operation also requires the layout of two input matrices, within the registers of a warp, to be conformat with hardware specification. The layout for the input matrix B of U8 data type in mixed-input matrix multiplication (F16 * U8) needs to conform with the converted F16 data type. This is called layout conformance and needs to be achieved in the software. The figure below shows an mma operation consuming matrix A and matrix B from registers to produce matrix C in registers, distributed across one warp. The thread T0 is highlighted and zoomed in to show the weight matrix B goes through data type conversion and needs a layout conformance to be able to map to the hardware-supported Tensor Core operation. The mapping of mixed-input (F32 = F16 * U8) operation in software to natively supported warp-level Tensor Cores in hardware (F32 = F16 * F16). (Original figure source Developing CUDA kernels to push Tensor Cores to the Absolute Limit on NVIDIA A100.) Software strategies addressing challenges A typical data type conversion involves a sequence of operations on 32-bit registers, shown below. Each rectangular block represents a register and the adjoining text are the operations. The entire sequence shows the conversion from 4xU8 to 2x(2xF16). The sequence involves roughly 10 operations. NumericArrayConvertor from 4xU8 to 2x(2xF16) in 32-bit registers. There are many ways of achieving layout conformance. Two of the existing solutions are: Narrower bitwidth shared memory loads: In this approach, threads issue narrow bitwidth memory loads moving the U8 data from shared memory to registers. This results in two 32-bit registers, with each register containing 2xF16 values (shown above for the matrix B\u2019s thread T0). The narrower shared memory load achieves layout conformance directly into registers without needing any shuffles; however, it does not utilize the full shared memory bandwidth. Pre-processing in global memory: An alternative strategy involves rearranging the data within the global memory (one level above the shared memory in memory hierarchy), allowing wider shared memory loads. This approach maximizes the shared memory bandwidth utilization and ensures that the data is loaded in a conformant layout directly in the registers. Although the rearrangement process can be executed offline prior to the LLM deployment, ensuring no impact on the application performance, it introduces an additional, non-trivial hardware-specific pre-processing step that requires an extra program to rearrange the data. NVIDIA/FasterTransformer adopts this method to effectively address layout conformance challenges. Optimized software strategies To further optimize and reduce the overhead of data type conversion and layout conformance, we have implemented FastNumericArrayConvertor and FragmentShuffler, respectively. FastNumericArrayConvertor operates on 4xU8 in 32-bit registers without unpacking individual 1xU8 values. Furthermore, it uses less expensive arithmetic operations which reduces the number of instructions and increases the speed of the conversion. The conversion sequence for U8-to-F16 is shown below. The operations use packed 32b registers, avoiding explicit unpacking and packing. FastNumericArrayConvertor uses the permute byte to rearrange bytes of 4xU8 into two registers. Additionally, FastNumericArrayConvertor does not use expensive integer to floating-point conversion instructions and employs vectorized operations to obtain the packed results in two 32-bit registers containing 2x(2xF16) values. The FastNumericArrayConvertor for U8-to-F16 approximately uses six operations, a 1.6\u00d7 reduction relative to the approach shown above. FastNumericArrayConvertor utilizes permute bytes and packed arithmetic, reducing the number of instructions in the data type conversion. FragmentShuffler handles the layout conformance by shuffling data in a way that allows the use of wider bitwidth load operation, increasing shared memory bandwidth utilization and reducing the total number of operations. NVIDIA Ampere architecture provides a load matrix instruction (ldmatrix). The ldmatrix is a warp-level operation, where 32 threads of a warp move the data from shared memory to registers in the shape and layout that mma matrix A and B consume. The use of ldmatrix reduces the number of load instructions and increases the memory bandwidth utilization. Since the ldmatrix instruction moves U8 data to registers, the layout after the load conforms with U8*U8 mma operation, and not with F16*F16 mma operation. We implemented FragmentShuffler to rearrange the data within registers using shuffle (shfl.sync) operations to achieve the layout conformance. The most significant contribution of this work is to achieve layout conformance through register shuffles, avoiding offline pre-processing in global memory or narrower bitwidth shared memory loads. Furthermore, we provide implementations for FastNumericArrayConvertor covering data type conversion from U8-to-F16, S8-to-F16, U8-to-BF16, and S8-to-BF16. Performance results We measured the performance of eight mixed-input variants of our method (shown below in blue and red; varying the data types of matrix A and B) and two mixed-precision data types (shown in green) on an NVIDIA A100 SXM chip. The performance results are shown in FLOPS (higher is better). Notably, the first eight matrix-multipications require additional operations relative to the last two, because the mixed-precision variants directly target hardware-accelerated Tensor Core operations and do not need data type conversion and layout conformance. Even so, our approach demonstrates mixed-input matrix multiplication performance only slightly below or on par with mixed-precision.

The backbone of these applications lies in large language models (LLMs).  LLMs are memory-intensive and typically require specialized hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/the-worlds-largest-distributed-llm-training-job-on-tpu-v5e\">tens of exaflops</a> of computing power. This blog post shows how we can start addressing the computational challenges by utilizing memory more effectively.\n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<p>\nThe bulk of an LLM\u2019s memory and compute are consumed by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf\">weights</a> in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16668.pdf\">matrix multiplication</a> operations. Using narrower <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type\">data types</a></em> reduces memory consumption. For example, storing weights in the 8-bit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)\">integer</a> (i.e., U8 or S8) data type reduces the memory footprint by 4\u00d7 relative to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format\">single-precision</a> (F32) and 2\u00d7 relative to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format\">half-precision</a> (F16) or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format\">bfloat16</a> (BF16). Furthermore, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01861.pdf\">previous work has</a> shown that LLM models running matrix multiplications with <em>weights</em> in S8 and <em>input</em> in F16 (preserving higher precision of the user-input) is an effective method for increasing the efficiency with acceptable trade-offs in accuracy. This technique is known as <em>weight-only quantization</em> and requires efficient implementation of matrix multiplication with <em>mixed-inputs</em>, e.g., half-precision input multiplied with 8-bits integer. Hardware accelerators, including GPUs, support a fixed set of data types, and thus, mixed-input matrix multiplication requires software transformations to map to the hardware operations.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo that end, in this blog we focus on mapping mixed-input matrix multiplication onto the <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/\">NVIDIA Ampere architecture</a>. We present software techniques addressing data type conversion and layout conformance to map mixed-input matrix multiplication efficiently onto hardware-supported data types and layouts. Our results show that the overhead of additional work in software is minimal and enables performance close to the peak hardware capabilities.

The techniques described here work for various combinations of mixed-input data types. \n</p>\n<p>\nA GPU programmer can access a <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#memory-hierarchy\">hierarchy of memory</a>, including global memory, shared memory, and registers, which are arranged in order of decreasing capacity but increasing speed. NVIDIA Ampere Tensor Core <span style=\"color: #54863f;\"><code>mma</code></span> operations consume input matrices from registers. Furthermore, input and output matrices are required to conform to a layout of data within a group of 32 threads known as a <em>warp</em>. The supported data type <em>and</em> layout within a warp are fixed for an <span style=\"color: #54863f;\"><code>mma</code></span> operation, so to implement mixed-input multiplication efficiently, it is necessary to solve the challenges of data type conversion and layout conformance in software. \n</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Data type conversion </h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThe <span style=\"color: #54863f;\"><code>mma</code></span> operation requires two input matrices with the same data type. Thus, mixed-input matrix multiplication, where one of the operands is stored in U8 in global memory and other in F16, requires a data type conversion from U8 to F16. The conversion will bring two operands to F16, mapping the <em>mixed-input</em> matrix multiplication to hardware-supported <em>mixed-precision</em> Tensor Cores.

      "summary_original": "Posted by Ameya Velingker, Research Scientist, Google Research, and Balaji Venkatachalam, Software Engineer, Google Graphs, in which objects and their relations are represented as nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) between pairs of nodes, are ubiquitous in computing and machine learning (ML). For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. A common approach to learning on graphs are graph neural networks (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a message-passing framework, whereby each layer aggregates the representation of a node with those of its immediate neighbors. Recently, graph transformer models have emerged as a popular alternative to message-passing GNNs. These models build on the success of Transformer architectures in natural language processing (NLP), adapting them to graph-structured data. The attention mechanism in graph transformers can be modeled by an interaction graph, in which edges represent pairs of nodes that attend to each other. Unlike message passing architectures, graph transformers have an interaction graph that is separate from the input graph. The typical interaction graph is a complete graph, which signifies a full attention mechanism that models direct interactions between all pairs of nodes. However, this creates quadratic computational and memory bottlenecks that limit the applicability of graph transformers to datasets on small graphs with at most a few thousand nodes. Making graph transformers scalable has been considered one of the most important research directions in the field (see the first open problem here). A natural remedy is to use a sparse interaction graph with fewer edges. Many sparse and efficient transformers have been proposed to eliminate the quadratic bottleneck for sequences, however, they do not generally extend to graphs in a principled manner. In \u201cExphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs\u201d, presented at ICML 2023, we address the scalability challenge by introducing a sparse attention framework for transformers that is designed specifically for graph data. The Exphormer framework makes use of expander graphs, a powerful tool from spectral graph theory, and is able to achieve strong empirical results on a wide variety of datasets. Our implementation of Exphormer is now available on GitHub. Expander graphs A key idea at the heart of Exphormer is the use of expander graphs, which are sparse yet well-connected graphs that have some useful properties \u2014 1) the matrix representation of the graphs have similar linear-algebraic properties as a complete graph, and 2) they exhibit rapid mixing of random walks, i.e., a small number of steps in a random walk from any starting node is enough to ensure convergence to a \u201cstable\u201d distribution on the nodes of the graph. Expanders have found applications to diverse areas, such as algorithms, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and error-correcting codes. A common class of expander graphs are d-regular expanders, in which there are d edges from every node (i.e., every node has degree d). The quality of an expander graph is measured by its spectral gap, an algebraic property of its adjacency matrix (a matrix representation of the graph in which rows and columns are indexed by nodes and entries indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected by an edge). Those that maximize the spectral gap are known as Ramanujan graphs \u2014 they achieve a gap of d - 2*\u221a(d-1), which is essentially the best possible among d-regular graphs. A number of deterministic and randomized constructions of Ramanujan graphs have been proposed over the years for various values of d. We use a randomized expander construction of Friedman, which produces near-Ramanujan graphs. Expander graphs are at the heart of Exphormer. A good expander is sparse yet exhibits rapid mixing of random walks, making its global connectivity suitable for an interaction graph in a graph transformer model. Exphormer replaces the dense, fully-connected interaction graph of a standard Transformer with edges of a sparse d-regular expander graph. Intuitively, the spectral approximation and mixing properties of an expander graph allow distant nodes to communicate with each other after one stacks multiple attention layers in a graph transformer architecture, even though the nodes may not attend to each other directly. Furthermore, by ensuring that d is constant (independent of the size of the number of nodes), we obtain a linear number of edges in the resulting interaction graph. Exphormer: Constructing a sparse interaction graph Exphormer combines expander edges with the input graph and virtual nodes. More specifically, the sparse attention mechanism of Exphormer builds an interaction graph consisting of three types of edges: Edges from the input graph (local attention) Edges from a constant-degree expander graph (expander attention) Edges from every node to a small set of virtual nodes (global attention) Exphormer builds an interaction graph by combining three types of edges. The resulting graph has good connectivity properties and retains the inductive bias of the input dataset graph while still remaining sparse. Each component serves a specific purpose: the edges from the input graph retain the inductive bias from the input graph structure (which typically gets lost in a fully-connected attention module). Meanwhile, expander edges allow good global connectivity and random walk mixing properties (which spectrally approximate the complete graph with far fewer edges). Finally, virtual nodes serve as global \u201cmemory sinks\u201d that can directly communicate with every node. While this results in additional edges from each virtual node equal to the number of nodes in the input graph, the resulting graph is still sparse. The degree of the expander graph and the number of virtual nodes are hyperparameters to tune for improving the quality metrics. Furthermore, since we use an expander graph of constant degree and a small constant number of virtual nodes for the global attention, the resulting sparse attention mechanism is linear in the size of the original input graph, i.e., it models a number of direct interactions on the order of the total number of nodes and edges. We additionally show that Exphormer is as expressive as the dense transformer and obeys universal approximation properties. In particular, when the sparse attention graph of Exphormer is augmented with self loops (edges connecting a node to itself), it can universally approximate continuous functions [1, 2]. Relation to sparse Transformers for sequences It is interesting to compare Exphormer to sparse attention methods for sequences. Perhaps the architecture most conceptually similar to our approach is BigBird, which builds an interaction graph by combining different components. BigBird also uses virtual nodes, but, unlike Exphormer, it uses window attention and random attention from an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph model for the remaining components. Window attention in BigBird looks at the tokens surrounding a token in a sequence \u2014 the local neighborhood attention in Exphormer can be viewed as a generalization of window attention to graphs. The Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph on n nodes, G(n, p), which connects every pair of nodes independently with probability p, also functions as an expander graph for suitably high p. However, a superlinear number of edges (\u03a9(n log n)) is needed to ensure that an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is connected, let alone a good expander. On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a linear number of edges. Experimental results Earlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated GraphGPS framework [3], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets. We show that replacing dense attention with Exphormer for the graph attention component in the GraphGPS framework allows one to achieve models with comparable or better performance, often with fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, Exphormer notably allows graph transformer architectures to scale well beyond the usual graph size limits mentioned above. Exphormer can scale up to datasets of 10,000+ node graphs, such as the Coauthor dataset, and even beyond to larger graphs such as the well-known ogbn-arxiv dataset, a citation network, which consists of 170K nodes and 1.1 million edges. Results comparing Exphormer to standard GraphGPS on the five Long Range Graph Benchmark datasets. We note that Exphormer achieved state-of-the-art results on four of the five datasets (PascalVOC-SP, COCO-SP, Peptides-Struct, PCQM-Contact) at the time of the paper\u2019s publication.

Results show that Exphormer-based models outperform standard GraphGPS models (which were previously state-of-the-art on four out of five datasets at the time of publication). Conclusion Graph transformers have emerged as an important architecture for ML that adapts the highly successful sequence-based transformers used in NLP to graph-structured data. Scalability has, however, proven to be a major challenge in enabling the use of graph transformers on datasets with large graphs. In this post, we have presented Exphormer, a sparse attention framework that uses expander graphs to improve scalability of graph transformers. Exphormer is shown to have important theoretical properties and exhibit strong empirical performance, particularly on datasets where it is crucial to learn long range dependencies.

However, this creates quadratic computational and memory bottlenecks that limit the applicability of graph transformers to datasets on small graphs with at most a few thousand nodes. Making graph transformers scalable has been considered one of the most important research directions in the field (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-ml-in-2022-where-are-we-now-f7f8242599e0\">the first open problem here</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\nA natural remedy is to use a <em>sparse</em> interaction graph with fewer edges. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3530811\">Many sparse and efficient transformers have been proposed</a> to eliminate the quadratic bottleneck for sequences, however, they do not generally extend to graphs in a principled manner.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06147\">Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/Dates\">ICML 2023</a>, we address the scalability challenge by introducing a sparse attention framework for transformers that is designed specifically for graph data. The Exphormer framework makes use of expander graphs, a powerful tool from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory\">spectral graph theory</a>, and is able to achieve strong empirical results on a wide variety of datasets. Our implementation of Exphormer is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer\">GitHub</a>.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Expander graphs</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA key idea at the heart of Exphormer is the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph\">expander graphs</a>, which are sparse yet well-connected graphs that have some useful properties \u2014 1) the matrix representation of the graphs have similar linear-algebraic properties as a complete graph, and 2) they exhibit rapid mixing of random walks, i.e., a small number of steps in a random walk from any starting node is enough to ensure convergence to a \u201cstable\u201d distribution on the nodes of the graph. Expanders have found applications to diverse areas, such as algorithms, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and error-correcting codes.\n</p>\n<p>\nA common class of expander graphs are <em>d</em>-regular expanders, in which there are <em>d</em> edges from every node (i.e., every node has degree <em>d</em>). The quality of an expander graph is measured by its <em>spectral gap</em>, an algebraic property of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix\">adjacency matrix</a> (a matrix representation of the graph in which rows and columns are indexed by nodes and entries indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected by an edge). Those that maximize the spectral gap are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph\">Ramanujan graphs</a> \u2014 they achieve a gap of <em>d</em> - 2*\u221a(<em>d</em>-1), which is essentially the best possible among <em>d</em>-regular graphs. A number of deterministic and randomized constructions of Ramanujan graphs have been proposed over the years for various values of <em>d</em>. We use a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0405020\">randomized expander construction of Friedman</a>, which produces near-Ramanujan graphs.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s843/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s320/image1.gif\" width=\"304\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2920b38b-7fff-2fa8-a3cd-06dfd3ba9968\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Expander graphs are at the heart of Exphormer.

More specifically, the sparse attention mechanism of Exphormer builds an interaction graph consisting of three types of edges:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Edges from the input graph (<em>local attention</em>)\n\n</li><li>Edges from a constant-degree expander graph (<em>expander attention</em>)\n\n</li><li>Edges from every node to a small set of virtual nodes (<em>global attention</em>)\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiS7VdL6OcWCmXd-wTtx-qs_nA7qTYZFJOTHS7RZNS3Io_w4km3NM4opPsQBXu1u50KjDA43CsG0hoi1l7I9gq_KGBMvwKEjlWQKBzCeytLQHujF-4K4r9E4F4Q0APvw7le4twjGbDyEiVfEzhbsovhzk2_g4Xd4jwCo66HW7xbnLvm3WPBsHaoq-hDAYX8/s800/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiS7VdL6OcWCmXd-wTtx-qs_nA7qTYZFJOTHS7RZNS3Io_w4km3NM4opPsQBXu1u50KjDA43CsG0hoi1l7I9gq_KGBMvwKEjlWQKBzCeytLQHujF-4K4r9E4F4Q0APvw7le4twjGbDyEiVfEzhbsovhzk2_g4Xd4jwCo66HW7xbnLvm3WPBsHaoq-hDAYX8/s16000/image1.gif\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ac11d16d-7fff-62da-cf18-7ba830f677d3\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Exphormer builds an interaction graph by combining three types of edges. The resulting graph has good connectivity properties and retains the inductive bias of the input dataset graph while still remaining sparse.</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>\n  Each component serves a specific purpose: the edges from the input graph retain the inductive bias from the input graph structure (which typically gets lost in a fully-connected attention module). Meanwhile, expander edges allow good global connectivity and random walk mixing properties (which spectrally approximate the complete graph with far fewer edges). Finally, virtual nodes serve as global \u201cmemory sinks\u201d that can directly communicate with every node. While this results in additional edges from each virtual node equal to the number of nodes in the input graph, the resulting graph is still sparse. The degree of the expander graph and the number of virtual nodes are hyperparameters to tune for improving the quality metrics.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, since we use an expander graph of constant degree and a small constant number of virtual nodes for the global attention, the resulting sparse attention mechanism is linear in the size of the original input graph, i.e., it models a number of direct interactions on the order of the total number of nodes and edges.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe additionally show that Exphormer is as expressive as the dense transformer and obeys universal approximation properties. In particular, when the sparse attention graph of Exphormer is augmented with self loops (edges connecting a node to itself), it can universally approximate continuous functions [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10077\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04862\">2</a>].\n</p>\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Relation to sparse Transformers for sequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nIt is interesting to compare Exphormer to sparse attention methods for sequences. Perhaps the architecture most conceptually similar to our approach is <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2021/03/constructing-transformers-for-longer.html\">BigBird</a>, which  builds an interaction graph by combining different components. BigBird also uses virtual nodes, but, unlike Exphormer, it uses window attention and random attention from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a> random graph model for the remaining components.\n</p>\n<p>\nWindow attention in BigBird looks at the tokens surrounding a token in a sequence \u2014 the local neighborhood attention in Exphormer can be viewed as a generalization of window attention to graphs.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph on <em>n</em> nodes, <em>G(n, p)</em>, which connects every pair of nodes independently with probability <em>p</em>, also functions as an expander graph for suitably high <em>p</em>. However, a superlinear number of edges (\u03a9(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>)) is needed to ensure that an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is connected, let alone a good expander. On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a <em>linear</em> number of edges.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEarlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated <a href=\"https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS\">GraphGPS framework</a> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454\">3</a>], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets. We show that replacing dense attention with Exphormer for the graph attention component in the GraphGPS framework allows one to achieve models with comparable or better performance, often with fewer trainable parameters.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, Exphormer notably allows graph transformer architectures to scale well beyond the usual graph size limits mentioned above. Exphormer can scale up to datasets of 10,000+ node graphs, such as the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05868\">Coauthor dataset</a>, and even beyond to larger graphs such as the well-known <a href=\"https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv\">ogbn-arxiv dataset</a>, a citation network, which consists of 170K nodes and 1.1 million edges.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Results comparing Exphormer to standard GraphGPS on the five <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08164\">Long Range Graph Benchmark</a> datasets.

The resulting graph has good connectivity properties and retains the inductive bias of the input dataset graph while still remaining sparse.</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>\n  Each component serves a specific purpose: the edges from the input graph retain the inductive bias from the input graph structure (which typically gets lost in a fully-connected attention module). Meanwhile, expander edges allow good global connectivity and random walk mixing properties (which spectrally approximate the complete graph with far fewer edges). Finally, virtual nodes serve as global \u201cmemory sinks\u201d that can directly communicate with every node. While this results in additional edges from each virtual node equal to the number of nodes in the input graph, the resulting graph is still sparse. The degree of the expander graph and the number of virtual nodes are hyperparameters to tune for improving the quality metrics.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, since we use an expander graph of constant degree and a small constant number of virtual nodes for the global attention, the resulting sparse attention mechanism is linear in the size of the original input graph, i.e., it models a number of direct interactions on the order of the total number of nodes and edges.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe additionally show that Exphormer is as expressive as the dense transformer and obeys universal approximation properties. In particular, when the sparse attention graph of Exphormer is augmented with self loops (edges connecting a node to itself), it can universally approximate continuous functions [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10077\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04862\">2</a>].\n</p>\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Relation to sparse Transformers for sequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nIt is interesting to compare Exphormer to sparse attention methods for sequences. Perhaps the architecture most conceptually similar to our approach is <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2021/03/constructing-transformers-for-longer.html\">BigBird</a>, which  builds an interaction graph by combining different components. BigBird also uses virtual nodes, but, unlike Exphormer, it uses window attention and random attention from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a> random graph model for the remaining components.\n</p>\n<p>\nWindow attention in BigBird looks at the tokens surrounding a token in a sequence \u2014 the local neighborhood attention in Exphormer can be viewed as a generalization of window attention to graphs.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph on <em>n</em> nodes, <em>G(n, p)</em>, which connects every pair of nodes independently with probability <em>p</em>, also functions as an expander graph for suitably high <em>p</em>. However, a superlinear number of edges (\u03a9(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>)) is needed to ensure that an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is connected, let alone a good expander. On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a <em>linear</em> number of edges.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEarlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated <a href=\"https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS\">GraphGPS framework</a> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454\">3</a>], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets. We show that replacing dense attention with Exphormer for the graph attention component in the GraphGPS framework allows one to achieve models with comparable or better performance, often with fewer trainable parameters.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, Exphormer notably allows graph transformer architectures to scale well beyond the usual graph size limits mentioned above. Exphormer can scale up to datasets of 10,000+ node graphs, such as the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05868\">Coauthor dataset</a>, and even beyond to larger graphs such as the well-known <a href=\"https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv\">ogbn-arxiv dataset</a>, a citation network, which consists of 170K nodes and 1.1 million edges.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Results comparing Exphormer to standard GraphGPS on the five <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08164\">Long Range Graph Benchmark</a> datasets.

For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>\nA common approach to learning on graphs are <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/\">graph neural networks</a> (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a <a href=\"https://wandb.ai/graph-neural-networks/spatial/reports/An-Introduction-to-Message-Passing-Graph-Neural-Networks--VmlldzoyMDI2NTg2\">message-passing</a> framework, whereby each layer aggregates the representation of a node with those of its immediate neighbors.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09699\">graph transformer models</a> have emerged as a popular alternative to message-passing GNNs. These models build on the success of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine-learning_model)\">Transformer architectures</a> in natural language processing (NLP), adapting them to graph-structured data. The attention mechanism in graph transformers can be modeled by an interaction graph, in which edges represent pairs of nodes that attend to each other. Unlike message passing architectures, graph transformers have an interaction graph that is separate from the input graph. The typical interaction graph is a complete graph, which signifies a full attention mechanism<em> </em>that models direct interactions between all pairs of nodes. However, this creates quadratic computational and memory bottlenecks that limit the applicability of graph transformers to datasets on small graphs with at most a few thousand nodes. Making graph transformers scalable has been considered one of the most important research directions in the field (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-ml-in-2022-where-are-we-now-f7f8242599e0\">the first open problem here</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\nA natural remedy is to use a <em>sparse</em> interaction graph with fewer edges. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3530811\">Many sparse and efficient transformers have been proposed</a> to eliminate the quadratic bottleneck for sequences, however, they do not generally extend to graphs in a principled manner.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06147\">Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/Dates\">ICML 2023</a>, we address the scalability challenge by introducing a sparse attention framework for transformers that is designed specifically for graph data. The Exphormer framework makes use of expander graphs, a powerful tool from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory\">spectral graph theory</a>, and is able to achieve strong empirical results on a wide variety of datasets. Our implementation of Exphormer is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer\">GitHub</a>.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Expander graphs</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA key idea at the heart of Exphormer is the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph\">expander graphs</a>, which are sparse yet well-connected graphs that have some useful properties \u2014 1) the matrix representation of the graphs have similar linear-algebraic properties as a complete graph, and 2) they exhibit rapid mixing of random walks, i.e., a small number of steps in a random walk from any starting node is enough to ensure convergence to a \u201cstable\u201d distribution on the nodes of the graph. Expanders have found applications to diverse areas, such as algorithms, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and error-correcting codes.\n</p>\n<p>\nA common class of expander graphs are <em>d</em>-regular expanders, in which there are <em>d</em> edges from every node (i.e., every node has degree <em>d</em>). The quality of an expander graph is measured by its <em>spectral gap</em>, an algebraic property of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix\">adjacency matrix</a> (a matrix representation of the graph in which rows and columns are indexed by nodes and entries indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected by an edge). Those that maximize the spectral gap are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph\">Ramanujan graphs</a> \u2014 they achieve a gap of <em>d</em> - 2*\u221a(<em>d</em>-1), which is essentially the best possible among <em>d</em>-regular graphs. A number of deterministic and randomized constructions of Ramanujan graphs have been proposed over the years for various values of <em>d</em>.

BigBird also uses virtual nodes, but, unlike Exphormer, it uses window attention and random attention from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a> random graph model for the remaining components.\n</p>\n<p>\nWindow attention in BigBird looks at the tokens surrounding a token in a sequence \u2014 the local neighborhood attention in Exphormer can be viewed as a generalization of window attention to graphs.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph on <em>n</em> nodes, <em>G(n, p)</em>, which connects every pair of nodes independently with probability <em>p</em>, also functions as an expander graph for suitably high <em>p</em>. However, a superlinear number of edges (\u03a9(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>)) is needed to ensure that an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is connected, let alone a good expander. On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a <em>linear</em> number of edges.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEarlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated <a href=\"https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS\">GraphGPS framework</a> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454\">3</a>], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets. We show that replacing dense attention with Exphormer for the graph attention component in the GraphGPS framework allows one to achieve models with comparable or better performance, often with fewer trainable parameters.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, Exphormer notably allows graph transformer architectures to scale well beyond the usual graph size limits mentioned above. Exphormer can scale up to datasets of 10,000+ node graphs, such as the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05868\">Coauthor dataset</a>, and even beyond to larger graphs such as the well-known <a href=\"https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv\">ogbn-arxiv dataset</a>, a citation network, which consists of 170K nodes and 1.1 million edges.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Results comparing Exphormer to standard GraphGPS on the five <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08164\">Long Range Graph Benchmark</a> datasets.

For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>\nA common approach to learning on graphs are <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/\">graph neural networks</a> (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a <a href=\"https://wandb.ai/graph-neural-networks/spatial/reports/An-Introduction-to-Message-Passing-Graph-Neural-Networks--VmlldzoyMDI2NTg2\">message-passing</a> framework, whereby each layer aggregates the representation of a node with those of its immediate neighbors.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09699\">graph transformer models</a> have emerged as a popular alternative to message-passing GNNs. These models build on the success of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine-learning_model)\">Transformer architectures</a> in natural language processing (NLP), adapting them to graph-structured data. The attention mechanism in graph transformers can be modeled by an interaction graph, in which edges represent pairs of nodes that attend to each other. Unlike message passing architectures, graph transformers have an interaction graph that is separate from the input graph. The typical interaction graph is a complete graph, which signifies a full attention mechanism<em> </em>that models direct interactions between all pairs of nodes. However, this creates quadratic computational and memory bottlenecks that limit the applicability of graph transformers to datasets on small graphs with at most a few thousand nodes. Making graph transformers scalable has been considered one of the most important research directions in the field (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-ml-in-2022-where-are-we-now-f7f8242599e0\">the first open problem here</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\nA natural remedy is to use a <em>sparse</em> interaction graph with fewer edges. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3530811\">Many sparse and efficient transformers have been proposed</a> to eliminate the quadratic bottleneck for sequences, however, they do not generally extend to graphs in a principled manner.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06147\">Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/Dates\">ICML 2023</a>, we address the scalability challenge by introducing a sparse attention framework for transformers that is designed specifically for graph data. The Exphormer framework makes use of expander graphs, a powerful tool from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory\">spectral graph theory</a>, and is able to achieve strong empirical results on a wide variety of datasets. Our implementation of Exphormer is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer\">GitHub</a>.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Expander graphs</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA key idea at the heart of Exphormer is the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph\">expander graphs</a>, which are sparse yet well-connected graphs that have some useful properties \u2014 1) the matrix representation of the graphs have similar linear-algebraic properties as a complete graph, and 2) they exhibit rapid mixing of random walks, i.e., a small number of steps in a random walk from any starting node is enough to ensure convergence to a \u201cstable\u201d distribution on the nodes of the graph. Expanders have found applications to diverse areas, such as algorithms, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and error-correcting codes.\n</p>\n<p>\nA common class of expander graphs are <em>d</em>-regular expanders, in which there are <em>d</em> edges from every node (i.e., every node has degree <em>d</em>). The quality of an expander graph is measured by its <em>spectral gap</em>, an algebraic property of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix\">adjacency matrix</a> (a matrix representation of the graph in which rows and columns are indexed by nodes and entries indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected by an edge). Those that maximize the spectral gap are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph\">Ramanujan graphs</a> \u2014 they achieve a gap of <em>d</em> - 2*\u221a(<em>d</em>-1), which is essentially the best possible among <em>d</em>-regular graphs. A number of deterministic and randomized constructions of Ramanujan graphs have been proposed over the years for various values of <em>d</em>. We use a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0405020\">randomized expander construction of Friedman</a>, which produces near-Ramanujan graphs.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s843/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s320/image1.gif\" width=\"304\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2920b38b-7fff-2fa8-a3cd-06dfd3ba9968\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Expander graphs are at the heart of Exphormer.

On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a <em>linear</em> number of edges.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEarlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated <a href=\"https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS\">GraphGPS framework</a> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454\">3</a>], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets. We show that replacing dense attention with Exphormer for the graph attention component in the GraphGPS framework allows one to achieve models with comparable or better performance, often with fewer trainable parameters.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, Exphormer notably allows graph transformer architectures to scale well beyond the usual graph size limits mentioned above. Exphormer can scale up to datasets of 10,000+ node graphs, such as the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05868\">Coauthor dataset</a>, and even beyond to larger graphs such as the well-known <a href=\"https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv\">ogbn-arxiv dataset</a>, a citation network, which consists of 170K nodes and 1.1 million edges.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-HJWH6mqX6N9ytZPbz6wawfMLzF2ey50Ot2BcowvPbQ3FaNwhlEZ3htvDbhq1C6ckLykf0yk3A1sIG0aPGaT8G_aSLj_A-AOfl8NIZdygdkn0C26RzZS9d-9KjyP1f_Zy7suN-iqvYR4zSCgqCXrhP8hVIirUgi6VGEBGx9I_AZikzc_ACKskBMBMPoSw/s1600/ExphormerPerformance.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Results comparing Exphormer to standard GraphGPS on the five <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08164\">Long Range Graph Benchmark</a> datasets.

Exphormer is shown to have important theoretical properties and exhibit strong empirical performance, particularly on datasets where it is crucial to learn long range dependencies.

For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. \n</p>\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>\nA common approach to learning on graphs are <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/\">graph neural networks</a> (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a <a href=\"https://wandb.ai/graph-neural-networks/spatial/reports/An-Introduction-to-Message-Passing-Graph-Neural-Networks--VmlldzoyMDI2NTg2\">message-passing</a> framework, whereby each layer aggregates the representation of a node with those of its immediate neighbors.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecently, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09699\">graph transformer models</a> have emerged as a popular alternative to message-passing GNNs. These models build on the success of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine-learning_model)\">Transformer architectures</a> in natural language processing (NLP), adapting them to graph-structured data. The attention mechanism in graph transformers can be modeled by an interaction graph, in which edges represent pairs of nodes that attend to each other. Unlike message passing architectures, graph transformers have an interaction graph that is separate from the input graph. The typical interaction graph is a complete graph, which signifies a full attention mechanism<em> </em>that models direct interactions between all pairs of nodes. However, this creates quadratic computational and memory bottlenecks that limit the applicability of graph transformers to datasets on small graphs with at most a few thousand nodes. Making graph transformers scalable has been considered one of the most important research directions in the field (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-ml-in-2022-where-are-we-now-f7f8242599e0\">the first open problem here</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\nA natural remedy is to use a <em>sparse</em> interaction graph with fewer edges. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3530811\">Many sparse and efficient transformers have been proposed</a> to eliminate the quadratic bottleneck for sequences, however, they do not generally extend to graphs in a principled manner.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06147\">Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs</a>\u201d, presented at <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/Dates\">ICML 2023</a>, we address the scalability challenge by introducing a sparse attention framework for transformers that is designed specifically for graph data. The Exphormer framework makes use of expander graphs, a powerful tool from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory\">spectral graph theory</a>, and is able to achieve strong empirical results on a wide variety of datasets. Our implementation of Exphormer is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer\">GitHub</a>.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Expander graphs</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA key idea at the heart of Exphormer is the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph\">expander graphs</a>, which are sparse yet well-connected graphs that have some useful properties \u2014 1) the matrix representation of the graphs have similar linear-algebraic properties as a complete graph, and 2) they exhibit rapid mixing of random walks, i.e., a small number of steps in a random walk from any starting node is enough to ensure convergence to a \u201cstable\u201d distribution on the nodes of the graph. Expanders have found applications to diverse areas, such as algorithms, pseudorandomness, complexity theory, and error-correcting codes.\n</p>\n<p>\nA common class of expander graphs are <em>d</em>-regular expanders, in which there are <em>d</em> edges from every node (i.e., every node has degree <em>d</em>). The quality of an expander graph is measured by its <em>spectral gap</em>, an algebraic property of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix\">adjacency matrix</a> (a matrix representation of the graph in which rows and columns are indexed by nodes and entries indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected by an edge). Those that maximize the spectral gap are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph\">Ramanujan graphs</a> \u2014 they achieve a gap of <em>d</em> - 2*\u221a(<em>d</em>-1), which is essentially the best possible among <em>d</em>-regular graphs. A number of deterministic and randomized constructions of Ramanujan graphs have been proposed over the years for various values of <em>d</em>. We use a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0405020\">randomized expander construction of Friedman</a>, which produces near-Ramanujan graphs.\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s843/image1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg495FZQZ12yMiNhU8C7XUKEJ88H5_v2PPrzhwcDOVnSaVEtdCXaL7py-LzwZZkybKwIaePLHKpdmD6qALfskdjeaA8ML9QYHMwWkxz2ZnhWYqoV1PpnNgbRRfm0pSVYJVrtUpONyyF5PfswJ_QoxD-9vI9F3rF6VQbIRDDIbgvOFc35vTEF9uxizKNpli9/s320/image1.gif\" width=\"304\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2920b38b-7fff-2fa8-a3cd-06dfd3ba9968\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Expander graphs are at the heart of Exphormer.

Intuitively, the spectral approximation and mixing properties of an expander graph allow distant nodes to communicate with each other after one stacks multiple attention layers in a graph transformer architecture, even though the nodes may not attend to each other directly. Furthermore, by ensuring that <em>d</em> is constant (independent of the size of the number of nodes), we obtain a linear number of edges in the resulting interaction graph.</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Exphormer: Constructing a sparse interaction graph</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nExphormer combines expander edges with the input graph and virtual nodes.

Meanwhile, expander edges allow good global connectivity and random walk mixing properties (which spectrally approximate the complete graph with far fewer edges). Finally, virtual nodes serve as global \u201cmemory sinks\u201d that can directly communicate with every node. While this results in additional edges from each virtual node equal to the number of nodes in the input graph, the resulting graph is still sparse. The degree of the expander graph and the number of virtual nodes are hyperparameters to tune for improving the quality metrics.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, since we use an expander graph of constant degree and a small constant number of virtual nodes for the global attention, the resulting sparse attention mechanism is linear in the size of the original input graph, i.e., it models a number of direct interactions on the order of the total number of nodes and edges.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe additionally show that Exphormer is as expressive as the dense transformer and obeys universal approximation properties. In particular, when the sparse attention graph of Exphormer is augmented with self loops (edges connecting a node to itself), it can universally approximate continuous functions [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10077\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04862\">2</a>].\n</p>\n<div style=\"line-height: 40%;\">\n    <br />\n</div>\n<h3>Relation to sparse Transformers for sequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nIt is interesting to compare Exphormer to sparse attention methods for sequences. Perhaps the architecture most conceptually similar to our approach is <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2021/03/constructing-transformers-for-longer.html\">BigBird</a>, which  builds an interaction graph by combining different components. BigBird also uses virtual nodes, but, unlike Exphormer, it uses window attention and random attention from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model\">Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi</a> random graph model for the remaining components.\n</p>\n<p>\nWindow attention in BigBird looks at the tokens surrounding a token in a sequence \u2014 the local neighborhood attention in Exphormer can be viewed as a generalization of window attention to graphs.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph on <em>n</em> nodes, <em>G(n, p)</em>, which connects every pair of nodes independently with probability <em>p</em>, also functions as an expander graph for suitably high <em>p</em>. However, a superlinear number of edges (\u03a9(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>)) is needed to ensure that an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is connected, let alone a good expander. On the other hand, the expanders used in Exphormer have only a <em>linear</em> number of edges.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Experimental results</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEarlier works have shown the use of full graph Transformer-based models on datasets with graphs of size up to 5,000 nodes. To evaluate the performance of Exphormer, we build upon the celebrated <a href=\"https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS\">GraphGPS framework</a> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454\">3</a>], which combines both message passing and graph transformers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets.

The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08164\">Long Range Graph Benchmark</a>&nbsp;is a suite of five graph learning datasets designed to measure the ability of models to capture long-range interactions. Results show that Exphormer-based models outperform standard GraphGPS models (which were previously state-of-the-art on four out of five datasets at the time of publication).\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nGraph transformers have emerged as an important architecture for ML that adapts the highly successful sequence-based transformers used in NLP to graph-structured data. Scalability has, however, proven to be a major challenge in enabling the use of graph transformers on datasets with large graphs. In this post, we have presented Exphormer, a sparse attention framework that uses expander graphs to improve scalability of graph transformers. Exphormer is shown to have important theoretical properties and exhibit strong empirical performance, particularly on datasets where it is crucial to learn long range dependencies. For more information, we point the reader to a short presentation <a href=\"https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/poster/23782\">video</a> from ICML 2023.\n</p>\n<br /> \n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n<em>We thank our research collaborators Hamed Shirzad and Danica J.

      "summary": "The React Conf 2021 was an online event attended by over half a million people worldwide who viewed talks on the latest in web development and participated through conference Discord.",
      "summary_original": "This blog site has been archived. Go to react.dev/blog to see the recent posts. Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf. In previous years, we\u2019ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features. This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events. All the talks are available to stream online. Here\u2019s a summary of what was shared on stage: React 18 and concurrent features In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18. React 18 adds the long-awaited concurrent renderer and updates to Suspense without any major breaking changes. Apps can upgrade to React 18 and begin gradually adopting concurrent features with the amount of effort on par with any other major release. This means there is no concurrent mode, only concurrent features. In the keynote, we also shared our vision for Suspense, Server Components, new React working groups, and our long-term many-platform vision for React Native. Watch the full keynote from Andrew Clark, Juan Tejada, Lauren Tan, and Rick Hanlon here: React 18 for Application Developers In the keynote, we also announced that the React 18 RC is available to try now. Pending further feedback, this is the exact version of React that we will publish to stable early next year. To try the React 18 RC, upgrade your dependencies: npm install react@rc react-dom@rc and switch to the new createRoot API: // before const container = document.getElementById('root'); ReactDOM.render(<App />, container); // after const container = document.getElementById('root'); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container); root.render(<App/>); For a demo of upgrading to React 18, see Shruti Kapoor\u2019s talk here: Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense React 18 also includes improvements to server-side rendering performance using Suspense. Streaming server rendering lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and stream that HTML to your users. In React 18, you can use Suspense to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster. For a deep dive, see Shaundai Person\u2019s talk here: The first React working group For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators. Together we worked to create our gradual adoption strategy and refine new APIs such as useId, useSyncExternalStore, and useInsertionEffect. For an overview of this work, see Aakansha\u2019 Doshi\u2019s talk: React Developer Tooling To support the new features in this release, we also announced the newly formed React DevTools team and a new Timeline Profiler to help developers debug their React apps. For more information and a demo of new DevTools features, see Brian Vaughn\u2019s talk: React without memo Looking further into the future, Xuan Huang (\u9ec4\u7384) shared an update from our React Labs research into an auto-memoizing compiler. Check out this talk for more information and a demo of the compiler prototype: React docs keynote Rachel Nabors kicked off a section of talks about learning and designing with React with a keynote about our investment in React\u2019s new docs: And more\u2026 We also heard talks on learning and designing with React: Debbie O\u2019Brien: Things I learnt from the new React docs. Sarah Rainsberger: Learning in the Browser. Linton Ye: The ROI of Designing with React. Delba de Oliveira: Interactive playgrounds with React. Talks from the Relay, React Native, and PyTorch teams: Robert Balicki: Re-introducing Relay. Eric Rozell and Steven Moyes: React Native Desktop. Roman R\u00e4dle: On-device Machine Learning for React Native And talks from the community on accessibility, tooling, and Server Components: Daishi Kato: React 18 for External Store Libraries. Diego Haz: Building Accessible Components in React 18. Tafu Nakazaki: Accessible Japanese Form Components with React. Lyle Troxell: UI tools for artists. Helen Lin: Hydrogen + React 18.

In React 18, you can use <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Suspense</code> to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.</p>\n<p>For a deep dive, see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaundai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shaundai Person</a>\u2019s talk here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">  </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-react-working-group\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/feed.xml#the-first-react-working-group\"><svg height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a>The first React working group </h2>\n<p>For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators.

In previous years, we\u2019ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2015/03/26/android/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>React Native</em></a> and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>React Hooks</em></a>. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.</p>\n<p>This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.</p>\n<p>All the talks are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ0cG47msEk&#x26;list=PLNG_1j3cPCaZZ7etkzWA7JfdmKWT0pMsa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available to stream online</a>.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a summary of what was shared on stage:</p>\n<h2 id=\"react-18-and-concurrent-features\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/feed.xml#react-18-and-concurrent-features\"><svg height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a>React 18 and concurrent features </h2>\n<p>In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18.</p>\n<p>React 18 adds the long-awaited concurrent renderer and updates to Suspense without any major breaking changes. Apps can upgrade to React 18 and begin gradually adopting concurrent features with the amount of effort on par with any other major release.</p>\n<p><strong>This means there is no concurrent mode, only concurrent features.</strong></p>\n<p>In the keynote, we also shared our vision for Suspense, Server Components, new React working groups, and our long-term many-platform vision for React Native.</p>\n<p>Watch the full keynote from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acdlite\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Clark</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_jstejada\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Juan Tejada</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/potetotes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren Tan</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Hanlon</a> here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">  </div>\n<h2 id=\"react-18-for-application-developers\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/feed.xml#react-18-for-application-developers\"><svg height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a>React 18 for Application Developers </h2>\n<p>In the keynote, we also announced that the React 18 RC is available to try now.
