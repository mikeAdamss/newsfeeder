It\u2019s the software that sits between your computer\u2019s hardware and the applications you run, managing resources and enabling communication between them. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is built collaboratively by developers around the world and is known for its stability, security, and flexibility Key Features of Linux Open source: Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code. Stable: Rarely crashes and handles long uptimes. Secure: Fewer viruses and robust user permission control. Flexible: Can be customized for desktops, servers, embedded devices. Multi-user and multitasking: Supports multiple users and concurrent tasks efficiently. History of Linux How Linux Took Over the Tech World\u2014In Simple Terms Early 1990s: A curious student named Linus Torvalds builds a small program (kernel) as a personal project. He shares it online, inviting others to join the ride. 1991: The first version of \u201cLinux\u201d is born. It's like the central engine (or heart) of a computer\u2014but it needs other pieces to become fully usable. Mid-1990s to 2000s: Developers across the globe start adding the missing tools and features. Different versions, called \"distributions\" like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat\u2014start popping up. 2000s: Linux becomes a go-to for powering servers. It later grows into mobile tech, forming the foundation for Android. Today: Linux is everywhere\u2014in phones, laptops, smart devices, cloud infrastructure, supercomputers, and even spacecraft. Thanks to open collaboration, it keeps evolving.

Both platforms were launched on 16th July 2025 during the institute\u2019s 14th Annual Convocation. It was a proud and unforgettable milestone in my journey. As a developer, there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing your work go live.

Singh, Dean, CAPS made the experience even more special. My Role in the Project I built both platforms from the ground up using the MERN stack, handling everything from front-end design to back-end logic and deployment. This end-to-end development journey provided valuable insight into how institutional platforms are envisioned, designed, and delivered while meeting real-world expectations.

Background: 36M, based in Madrid ~14 years in tech (started in network/security, transitioned to DevOps ~6 years ago) Currently Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer at a mid-size company Have experience with the usual stack: AWS/Azure/GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, etc. Currently finishing my Master's in AI (should be done by July) The problem: I feel completely stagnated. I've been bouncing between companies every 1-3 years trying to find growth, but I keep ending up in similar roles doing similar work. The pay is decent but not amazing, and I honestly don't know what my next move should be. Some days I think about: Going deeper into platform engineering/SRE Leveraging my AI Master's to pivot into MLOps/AI infrastructure Moving into management (though I have zero leadership experience) Maybe even switching to software development completely Looking into remote work for international companies (better pay?) What I'm struggling with: I don't have a clear 5-year vision of where I want to be Not sure if I should specialize deeper or go broader Feel like I'm behind compared to peers who seem to have clearer paths Impostor syndrome is real - sometimes feel like I'm just copying configurations without truly innovating Market seems super competitive right now, especially in Europe Questions: For those who made it to senior+ levels in DevOps/Platform Engineering - what differentiated you? Is it worth pursuing the AI/MLOps angle given my current background + upcoming Master's? How do you know when it's time to pivot vs. when to stick it out and go deeper? Any specific skills or certifications that actually matter for career progression? Should I be looking internationally or focusing on local market? I know this is pretty scattered, but I'm genuinely feeling lost and would appreciate any advice from people who've been through similar situations. Thanks in advance!

      "title": "Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes",
      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/18/pqc-in-k8s/",
      "summary": "Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing Kubernetes against future quantum computing threats.",
      "summary_original": "The world of cryptography is on the cusp of a major shift with the advent of quantum computing. While powerful quantum computers are still largely theoretical for many applications, their potential to break current cryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived systems. This is where Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) comes in. In this article, I'll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the Kubernetes ecosystem. I'll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in Kubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters. What is Post-Quantum Cryptography Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary concern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like Shor's Algorithm, could efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today's secure communication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing and adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by NIST is the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), formerly known as Kyber, and now standardized as FIPS-203 (PDF download). It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break classical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to PQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the predicted timeline we can look at a NIST report covering the transition to post-quantum cryptography standards. It declares that system with classical crypto should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035. Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines In TLS, there are two main cryptographic operations we need to secure: Key Exchange: This is how the client and server agree on a shared secret to encrypt their communication. If an attacker records encrypted traffic today, they could decrypt it in the future, if they gain access to a quantum computer capable of breaking the key exchange. This makes migrating KEMs to PQC an immediate priority. Digital Signatures: These are primarily used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client) via certificates. The authenticity of a server is verified at the time of connection. While important, the risk of an attack today is much lower, because the decision of trusting a server cannot be abused after the fact. Additionally, current PQC signature schemes often come with significant computational overhead and larger key/signature sizes compared to their classical counterparts. Another significant hurdle in the migration to PQ certificates is the upgrade of root certificates. These certificates have long validity periods and are installed in many devices and operating systems as trust anchors. Given these differences, the focus for immediate PQC adoption in TLS has been on hybrid key exchange mechanisms. These combine a classical algorithm (such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)) with a PQC algorithm (such as ML-KEM). The resulting shared secret is secure as long as at least one of the component algorithms remains unbroken. The X25519MLKEM768 hybrid scheme is the most widely supported one. State of PQC key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) today Support for PQC KEMs is rapidly improving across the ecosystem. Go: The Go standard library's crypto/tls package introduced support for X25519MLKEM768 in version 1.24 (released February 2025). Crucially, it's enabled by default when there is no explicit configuration, i.e., Config.CurvePreferences is nil. Browsers & OpenSSL: Major browsers like Chrome (version 131, November 2024) and Firefox (version 135, February 2025), as well as OpenSSL (version 3.5.0, April 2025), have also added support for the ML-KEM based hybrid scheme. Apple is also rolling out support for X25519MLKEM768 in version 26 of their operating systems. Given the proliferation of Apple devices, this will have a significant impact on the global PQC adoption. For a more detailed overview of the state of PQC in the wider industry, see this blog post by Cloudflare. Post-quantum KEMs in Kubernetes: an unexpected arrival So, what does this mean for Kubernetes? Kubernetes components, including the API server and kubelet, are built with Go. As of Kubernetes v1.33, released in April 2025, the project uses Go 1.24. A quick check of the Kubernetes codebase reveals that Config.CurvePreferences is not explicitly set. This leads to a fascinating conclusion: Kubernetes v1.33, by virtue of using Go 1.24, supports hybrid post-quantum X25519MLKEM768 for TLS connections by default! You can test this yourself. If you set up a Minikube cluster running Kubernetes v1.33.0, you can connect to the API server using a recent OpenSSL client: $ minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.33.0 $ kubectl cluster-info Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:<PORT> $ kubectl config view --minify --raw -o jsonpath=\\'{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}\\' | base64 -d > ca.crt $ openssl version OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025) $ echo -n \"Q\" | openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:<PORT> -CAfile ca.crt [...] Negotiated TLS1.3 group: X25519MLKEM768 [...] DONE Lo and behold, the negotiated group is X25519MLKEM768! This is a significant step towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe, seemingly without a major announcement or dedicated KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal). The Go version mismatch pitfall An interesting wrinkle emerged with Go versions 1.23 and 1.24. Go 1.23 included experimental support for a draft version of ML-KEM, identified as X25519Kyber768Draft00. This was also enabled by default if Config.CurvePreferences was nil. Kubernetes v1.32 used Go 1.23. However, Go 1.24 removed the draft support and replaced it with the standardized version X25519MLKEM768. What happens if a client and server are using mismatched Go versions (one on 1.23, the other on 1.24)? They won't have a common PQC KEM to negotiate, and the handshake will fall back to classical ECC curves (e.g., X25519). How could this happen in practice? Consider a scenario: A Kubernetes cluster is running v1.32 (using Go 1.23 and thus X25519Kyber768Draft00). A developer upgrades their kubectl to v1.33, compiled with Go 1.24, only supporting X25519MLKEM768. Now, when kubectl communicates with the v1.32 API server, they no longer share a common PQC algorithm. The connection will downgrade to classical cryptography, silently losing the PQC protection that has been in place. This highlights the importance of understanding the implications of Go version upgrades, and the details of the TLS stack. Limitations: packet size One practical consideration with ML-KEM is the size of its public keys with encoded key sizes of around 1.2 kilobytes for ML-KEM-768. This can cause the initial TLS ClientHello message not to fit inside a single TCP/IP packet, given the typical networking constraints (most commonly, the standard Ethernet frame size limit of 1500 bytes). Some TLS libraries or network appliances might not handle this gracefully, assuming the Client Hello always fits in one packet. This issue has been observed in some Kubernetes-related projects and networking components, potentially leading to connection failures when PQC KEMs are used. More details can be found at tldr.fail. State of Post-Quantum Signatures While KEMs are seeing broader adoption, PQC digital signatures are further behind in terms of widespread integration into standard toolchains. NIST has published standards for PQC signatures, such as ML-DSA (FIPS-204) and SLH-DSA (FIPS-205). However, implementing these in a way that's broadly usable (e.g., for PQC Certificate Authorities) presents challenges: Larger Keys and Signatures: PQC signature schemes often have significantly larger public keys and signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like Ed25519 or RSA. For instance, Dilithium2 keys can be 30 times larger than Ed25519 keys, and certificates can be 12 times larger. Performance: Signing and verification operations can be substantially slower. While some algorithms are on par with classical algorithms, others may have a much higher overhead, sometimes on the order of 10x to 1000x worse performance. To improve this situation, NIST is running a second round of standardization for PQC signatures. Toolchain Support: Mainstream TLS libraries and CA software do not yet have mature, built-in support for these new signature algorithms. The Go team, for example, has indicated that ML-DSA support is a high priority, but the soonest it might appear in the standard library is Go 1.26 (as of May 2025). Cloudflare's CIRCL (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library) library implements some PQC signature schemes like variants of Dilithium, and they maintain a fork of Go (cfgo) that integrates CIRCL. Using cfgo, it's possible to experiment with generating certificates signed with PQC algorithms like Ed25519-Dilithium2. However, this requires using a custom Go toolchain and is not yet part of the mainstream Kubernetes or Go distributions. Conclusion The journey to a post-quantum secure Kubernetes is underway, and perhaps further along than many realize, thanks to the proactive adoption of ML-KEM in Go. With Kubernetes v1.33, users are already benefiting from hybrid post-quantum key exchange in many TLS connections by default. However, awareness of potential pitfalls, such as Go version mismatches leading to downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes, is crucial. While PQC for KEMs is becoming a reality, PQC for digital signatures and certificate hierarchies is still in earlier stages of development and adoption for mainstream use. As Kubernetes maintainers and contributors, staying informed about these developments will be key to ensuring the long-term security of the platform.",

This is a significant\nstep towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe, seemingly without a major\nannouncement or dedicated KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-go-version-mismatch-pitfall\">The Go version mismatch pitfall</h2>\n<p>An interesting wrinkle emerged with Go versions 1.23 and 1.24. Go 1.23\nincluded experimental support for a draft version of <code>ML-KEM</code>, identified as\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>. This was also enabled by default if\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> was <code>nil</code>. Kubernetes v1.32 used Go 1.23. However,\nGo 1.24 removed the draft support and replaced it with the standardized version\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.</p>\n<p>What happens if a client and server are using mismatched Go versions (one on\n1.23, the other on 1.24)? They won't have a common PQC KEM to negotiate, and\nthe handshake will fall back to classical ECC curves (e.g., <code>X25519</code>). How\ncould this happen in practice?</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario:</p>\n<p>A Kubernetes cluster is running v1.32 (using Go 1.23 and thus\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>). A developer upgrades their <code>kubectl</code> to v1.33,\ncompiled with Go 1.24, only supporting <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>. Now, when <code>kubectl</code>\ncommunicates with the v1.32 API server, they no longer share a common PQC\nalgorithm. The connection will downgrade to classical cryptography, silently\nlosing the PQC protection that has been in place. This highlights the\nimportance of understanding the implications of Go version upgrades, and the\ndetails of the TLS stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitation-packet-size\">Limitations: packet size</h2>\n<p>One practical consideration with <code>ML-KEM</code> is the size of its public keys\nwith encoded key sizes of around 1.2 kilobytes for <code>ML-KEM-768</code>.\nThis can cause the initial TLS <code>ClientHello</code> message not to fit inside\na single TCP/IP packet, given the typical networking constraints\n(most commonly, the standard Ethernet frame size limit of 1500\nbytes). Some TLS libraries or network appliances might not handle this\ngracefully, assuming the Client Hello always fits in one packet. This issue\nhas been observed in some Kubernetes-related projects and networking\ncomponents, potentially leading to connection failures when PQC KEMs are used.\nMore details can be found at <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\">tldr.fail</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-post-quantum-signatures\">State of Post-Quantum Signatures</h2>\n<p>While KEMs are seeing broader adoption, PQC digital signatures are further\nbehind in terms of widespread integration into standard toolchains. NIST has\npublished standards for PQC signatures, such as <code>ML-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-204</code>) and\n<code>SLH-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-205</code>). However, implementing these in a way that's broadly\nusable (e.g., for PQC Certificate Authorities) <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#the-algorithms\">presents challenges</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Larger Keys and Signatures</strong>: PQC signature schemes often have significantly\nlarger public keys and signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like\nEd25519 or RSA. For instance, Dilithium2 keys can be 30 times larger than\nEd25519 keys, and certificates can be 12 times larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Signing and verification operations <a href=\"https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/\">can be substantially slower</a>.\nWhile some algorithms are on par with classical algorithms, others may have a\nmuch higher overhead, sometimes on the order of 10x to 1000x worse performance.\nTo improve this situation, NIST is running a\n<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/pqc-digital-signature-second-round-announcement\">second round of standardization</a> for PQC signatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Toolchain Support</strong>: Mainstream TLS libraries and CA software do not yet have\nmature, built-in support for these new signature algorithms. The Go team, for\nexample, has indicated that <code>ML-DSA</code> support is a high priority, but the\nsoonest it might appear in the standard library is Go 1.26 <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537#issuecomment-2877714729\">(as of May 2025)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/circl\">Cloudflare's CIRCL</a> (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library)\nlibrary implements some PQC signature schemes like variants of Dilithium, and\nthey maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/go\">fork of Go (cfgo)</a> that integrates CIRCL. Using <code>cfgo</code>, it's\npossible to experiment with generating certificates signed with PQC algorithms\nlike Ed25519-Dilithium2. However, this requires using a custom Go toolchain and\nis not yet part of the mainstream Kubernetes or Go distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The journey to a post-quantum secure Kubernetes is underway, and perhaps\nfurther along than many realize, thanks to the proactive adoption of <code>ML-KEM</code>\nin Go. With Kubernetes v1.33, users are already benefiting from hybrid post-quantum key\nexchange in many TLS connections by default.</p>\n<p>However, awareness of potential pitfalls, such as Go version mismatches leading\nto downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes, is crucial. While PQC\nfor KEMs is becoming a reality, PQC for digital signatures and certificate\nhierarchies is still in earlier stages of development and adoption for\nmainstream use. As Kubernetes maintainers and contributors, staying informed\nabout these developments will be key to ensuring the long-term security of the\nplatform.</p>"

      "summary": "The Open Container Initiative has been supplemented by Kubernetes' Node Feature Discovery to address gaps in expressing specific operating system configuration and hardware requirements for.",
      "summary_original": "In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence. It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI), a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. The need for image compatibility specification Dependencies between containers and host OS A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: Drivers: Host driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers. Libraries or Software: The container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband. Kernel Modules or Features: Specific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO And more\u2026 While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache. Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges. Often those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable. For instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like: RHCOS/RHEL Photon OS Amazon Linux 2 Container-Optimized OS Azure Linux OS And more... Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features. It must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment. Image compatibility initiative An effort was made within the Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata. A specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable. The specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals. It aims to: Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests. Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries. Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers. The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project. Implementation in Node Feature Discovery The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the NodeFeatureGroup API. This interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization. Compatibility specification The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing Node Feature Groups. These objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes. The feature requirements are described by using the list of available features from the NFD project. The schema has the following structure: version (string) - Specifies the API version. compatibilities (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets. rules (object) - Specifies NodeFeatureGroup to define image requirements. weight (int, optional) - Node affinity weight. tag (string, optional) - Categorization tag. description (string, optional) - Short description. An example might look like the following: version: v1alpha1 compatibilities: - description: \"My image requirements\" rules: - name: \"kernel and cpu\" matchFeatures: - feature: kernel.loadedmodule matchExpressions: vfio-pci: {op: Exists} - feature: cpu.model matchExpressions: vendor_id: {op: In, value: [\"Intel\", \"AMD\"]} - name: \"one of available nics\" matchAny: - matchFeatures: - feature: pci.device matchExpressions: vendor: {op: In, value: [\"0eee\"]} class: {op: In, value: [\"0200\"]} - matchFeatures: - feature: pci.device matchExpressions: vendor: {op: In, value: [\"0fff\"]} class: {op: In, value: [\"0200\"]} Client implementation for node validation To streamline compatibility validation, we implemented a client tool that allows for node validation based on an image's compatibility artifact. In this workflow, the image author would generate a compatibility artifact that points to the image it describes in a registry via the referrers API. When a need arises to assess the fit of an image to a host, the tool can discover the artifact and verify compatibility of an image to a node before deployment. The client can validate nodes both inside and outside a Kubernetes cluster, extending the utility of the tool beyond the single Kubernetes use case. In the future, image compatibility could play a crucial role in creating specific workload profiles based on image compatibility requirements, aiding in more efficient scheduling. Additionally, it could potentially enable automatic node configuration to some extent, further optimizing resource allocation and ensuring seamless deployment of specialized workloads. Examples of usage Define image compatibility metadata A container image can have metadata that describes its requirements based on features discovered from nodes, like kernel modules or CPU models. The previous compatibility specification example in this article exemplified this use case. Attach the artifact to the image The image compatibility specification is stored as an OCI artifact. You can attach this metadata to your container image using the oras tool. The registry only needs to support OCI artifacts, support for arbitrary types is not required. Keep in mind that the container image and the artifact must be stored in the same registry. Use the following command to attach the artifact to the image: oras attach \\ --artifact-type application/vnd.nfd.image-compatibility.v1alpha1 <image-url> \\ <path-to-spec>.yaml:application/vnd.nfd.image-compatibility.spec.v1alpha1+yaml Validate image compatibility After attaching the compatibility specification, you can validate whether a node meets the image's requirements. This validation can be done using the nfd client: nfd compat validate-node --image <image-url> Read the output from the client Finally you can read the report generated by the tool or use your own tools to act based on the generated JSON report. Conclusion The addition of image compatibility to Kubernetes through Node Feature Discovery underscores the growing importance of addressing compatibility in cloud native environments. It is only a start, as further work is needed to integrate compatibility into scheduling of workloads within and outside of Kubernetes. However, by integrating this feature into Kubernetes, mission-critical workloads can now define and validate host OS requirements more efficiently. Moving forward, the adoption of compatibility metadata within Kubernetes ecosystems will significantly enhance the reliability and performance of specialized containerized applications, ensuring they meet the stringent requirements of industries like telecommunications, high-performance computing or any environment that requires special hardware or host OS configuration.

          "summary_text": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

          "summary_text": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

          "summary_text": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more\u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "title": "Start Sidecar First: How To Avoid Snags",
      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/03/start-sidecar-first/",
      "summary": "-",
      "summary_original": "From the Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview blog post you know what their job is, what are the main architectural patterns, and how they are implemented in Kubernetes. The main thing I\u2019ll cover in this article is how to ensure that your sidecar containers start before the main app. It\u2019s more complicated than you might think! A gentle refresher I'd just like to remind readers that the v1.29.0 release of Kubernetes added native support for sidecar containers, which can now be defined within the .spec.initContainers field, but with restartPolicy: Always. You can see that illustrated in the following example Pod manifest snippet: initContainers: - name: logshipper image: alpine:latest restartPolicy: Always # this is what makes it a sidecar container command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -F /opt/logs.txt'] volumeMounts: - name: data mountPath: /opt What are the specifics of defining sidecars with a .spec.initContainers block, rather than as a legacy multi-container pod with multiple .spec.containers? Well, all .spec.initContainers are always launched before the main application. If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated after the main application. Furthermore, when used with Jobs, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion. To learn more, you can also read the official Pod sidecar containers tutorial. The problem Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the kubelet source code, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve. It might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there\u2019s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously \"I succeeded\". With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say \"a thing is running\". Starting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It\u2019s also actually how I\u2019d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn\u2019t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the \u201cbest practice\u201d solution), but sometimes they can\u2019t - and this post focuses on this use case. I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work. Readiness probe To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let\u2019s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I\u2019ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a readiness probe checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services. (Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have probes so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.) apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: myapp labels: app: myapp spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: myapp template: metadata: labels: app: myapp spec: containers: - name: myapp image: alpine:latest command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 3600\"] initContainers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest restartPolicy: Always ports: - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP readinessProbe: exec: command: - /bin/sh - -c - exit 1 # this command always fails, keeping the container \"Not Ready\" periodSeconds: 5 volumes: - name: data emptyDir: {} The result is: controlplane $ kubectl get pods -w NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE myapp-db5474f45-htgw5 1/2 Running 0 9m28s controlplane $ kubectl describe pod myapp-db5474f45-htgw5 Name: myapp-db5474f45-htgw5 Namespace: default (...)

Image size: 72080558 bytes.

Image size: 3652536 bytes. Normal Created 15s kubelet Created container myapp Normal Started 15s kubelet Started container myapp Warning Unhealthy 1s (x6 over 15s) kubelet Readiness probe failed: From these logs it\u2019s evident that only one container is ready - and I know it can\u2019t be the sidecar, because I\u2019ve defined it so it\u2019ll never be ready (you can also check container statuses in kubectl get pod -o json). I also saw that myapp has been started before the sidecar is ready. That was not the result I wanted to achieve; in this case, the main app container has a hard dependency on its sidecar. Maybe a startup probe? To ensure that the sidecar is ready before the main app container starts, I can define a startupProbe. It will delay the start of the main container until the command is successfully executed (returns 0 exit status). If you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019ve added it to my initContainer, let\u2019s analyse what happens If I\u2019d added it to myapp container. I wouldn\u2019t have guaranteed the probe would run before the main application code - and this one, can potentially error out without the sidecar being up and running. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: myapp labels: app: myapp spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: myapp template: metadata: labels: app: myapp spec: containers: - name: myapp image: alpine:latest command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 3600\"] initContainers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest ports: - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP restartPolicy: Always startupProbe: httpGet: path: / port: 80 initialDelaySeconds: 5 periodSeconds: 30 failureThreshold: 10 timeoutSeconds: 20 volumes: - name: data emptyDir: {} This results in 2/2 containers being ready and running, and from events, it can be inferred that the main application started only after nginx had already been started. But to confirm whether it waited for the sidecar readiness, let\u2019s change the startupProbe to the exec type of command: startupProbe: exec: command: - /bin/sh - -c - sleep 15 and run kubectl get pods -w to watch in real time whether the readiness of both containers only changes after a 15 second delay. Again, events confirm the main application starts after the sidecar. That means that using the startupProbe with a correct startupProbe.httpGet request helps to delay the main application start until the sidecar is ready. It\u2019s not optimal, but it works. What about the postStart lifecycle hook? Fun fact: using the postStart lifecycle hook block will also do the job, but I\u2019d have to write my own mini-shell script, which is even less efficient. initContainers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest restartPolicy: Always ports: - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP lifecycle: postStart: exec: command: - /bin/sh - -c - | echo \"Waiting for readiness at http://localhost:80\" until curl -sf http://localhost:80; do echo \"Still waiting for http://localhost:80...\" sleep 5 done echo \"Service is ready at http://localhost:80\" Liveness probe An interesting exercise would be to check the sidecar container behavior with a liveness probe. A liveness probe behaves and is configured similarly to a readiness probe - only with the difference that it doesn\u2019t affect the readiness of the container but restarts it in case the probe fails. livenessProbe: exec: command: - /bin/sh - -c - exit 1 # this command always fails, keeping the container \"Not Ready\" periodSeconds: 5 After adding the liveness probe configured just as the previous readiness probe and checking events of the pod by kubectl describe pod it\u2019s visible that the sidecar has a restart count above 0. Nevertheless, the main application is not restarted nor influenced at all, even though I'm aware that (in our imaginary worst-case scenario) it can error out when the sidecar is not there serving requests. What if I\u2019d used a livenessProbe without lifecycle postStart? Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn\u2019t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won\u2019t influence the main container. Findings summary I\u2019ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below: Probe/Hook Sidecar starts before the main app? Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready? What if the check doesn\u2019t pass? readinessProbe Yes, but it\u2019s almost in parallel (effectively no) No Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running livenessProbe Yes, but it\u2019s almost in parallel (effectively no) No Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running startupProbe Yes Yes Main app is not started postStart Yes, main app container starts after postStart completes Yes, but you have to provide custom logic for that Main app is not started To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy. The ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it\u2019s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it\u2019s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above. Happy deploying!",

You can see that illustrated in the following example Pod manifest snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">initContainers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>logshipper<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>alpine:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">restartPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Always<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this is what makes it a sidecar container</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">'sh'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'-c'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'tail -F /opt/logs.txt'</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">volumeMounts</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>data<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">mountPath</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>/opt<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>What are the specifics of defining sidecars with a <code>.spec.initContainers</code> block, rather than as a legacy multi-container pod with multiple <code>.spec.containers</code>?\nWell, all <code>.spec.initContainers</code> are always launched <strong>before</strong> the main application. If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there\u2019s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It\u2019s also actually how I\u2019d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn\u2019t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the \u201cbest practice\u201d solution), but sometimes they can\u2019t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let\u2019s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I\u2019ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn\u2019t affect readiness at all.

If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition.

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there\u2019s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It\u2019s also actually how I\u2019d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn\u2019t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the \u201cbest practice\u201d solution), but sometimes they can\u2019t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let\u2019s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I\u2019ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

It will delay the start of the main container until the command is successfully executed (returns <code>0</code> exit status).

Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn\u2019t affect readiness at all.

If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition.

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there\u2019s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It\u2019s also actually how I\u2019d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn\u2019t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the \u201cbest practice\u201d solution), but sometimes they can\u2019t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let\u2019s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I\u2019ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn\u2019t affect readiness at all.

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there\u2019s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It\u2019s also actually how I\u2019d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn\u2019t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the \u201cbest practice\u201d solution), but sometimes they can\u2019t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let\u2019s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I\u2019ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "The release of Gateway API v1.",
      "summary_original": "Join us in the Kubernetes SIG Network community in celebrating the general availability of Gateway API v1.3.0! We are also pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant implementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog announcement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on April 24, 2025. Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the Standard channel (Gateway API's GA release channel): percentage-based request mirroring, and introduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) filters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry budgets. Also see the full release notes and applaud the v1.3.0 release team next time you see them. Graduation to Standard channel Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API features, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network) certainly expect further refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how all of this works, refer to the Gateway API Versioning Policy. Percentage-based request mirroring Leads: Lior Lieberman,Jake Bennert GEP-3171: Percentage-Based Request Mirroring Percentage-based request mirroring is an enhancement to the existing support for HTTP request mirroring, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the RequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in blue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on application performance without impacting responses to clients. The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a backendRef. Percentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests they want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be particularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests. Instead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to mirror a smaller subset of them. Here's an example with 42% of the requests to \"foo-v1\" being mirrored to \"foo-v2\": apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: http-filter-mirror labels: gateway: mirror-gateway spec: parentRefs: - name: mirror-gateway hostnames: - mirror.example rules: - backendRefs: - name: foo-v1 port: 8080 filters: - type: RequestMirror requestMirror: backendRef: name: foo-v2 port: 8080 percent: 42 # This value must be an integer. You can also configure the partial mirroring using a fraction. Here is an example with 5 out of every 1000 requests to \"foo-v1\" being mirrored to \"foo-v2\". rules: - backendRefs: - name: foo-v1 port: 8080 filters: - type: RequestMirror requestMirror: backendRef: name: foo-v2 port: 8080 fraction: numerator: 5 denominator: 1000 Additions to Experimental channel The Experimental channel is Gateway API's channel for experimenting with new features and gaining confidence with them before allowing them to graduate to standard. Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are changed or removed later. Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel resources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the prefix \"X\". For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the API group gateway.networking.x-k8s.io instead of gateway.networking.k8s.io. Bear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist with standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard channel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API group (both of which lack the \"x-k8s\" designator or \"X\" prefix). The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy and XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install the Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below. CORS filtering Leads: Liang Li, Eyal Pazz, Rob Scott GEP-1767: CORS Filter Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain, scheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page. This feature adds a new HTTPRoute filter type, called \"CORS\", to configure the handling of cross-origin requests before the response is sent back to the client. To be able to use experimental CORS filtering, you need to install the Experimental channel Gateway API HTTPRoute yaml. Here's an example of a simple cross-origin configuration: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: http-route-cors spec: parentRefs: - name: http-gateway rules: - matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: /resource/foo filters: - cors: - type: CORS allowOrigins: - * allowMethods: - GET - HEAD - POST allowHeaders: - Accept - Accept-Language - Content-Language - Content-Type - Range backendRefs: - kind: Service name: http-route-cors port: 80 In this case, the Gateway returns an origin header of \"*\", which means that the requested resource can be referenced from any origin, a methods header (Access-Control-Allow-Methods) that permits the GET, HEAD, and POST verbs, and a headers header allowing Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type, and Range. HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept,Accept-Language,Content-Language,Content-Type,Range The complete list of fields in the new CORS filter: allowOrigins allowMethods allowHeaders allowCredentials exposeHeaders maxAge See CORS protocol for details. XListenerSets (standardized mechanism for Listener and Gateway merging) Lead: Dave Protasowski GEP-1713: ListenerSets - Standard Mechanism to Merge Multiple Gateways This release adds a new experimental API kind, XListenerSet, that allows a shared list of listeners to be attached to one or more parent Gateway(s). In addition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations may merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also: adds a new field allowedListeners to the .spec of a Gateway. The allowedListeners field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets that are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based. increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of XListenerSets. allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in other namespaces. To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml. The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS XListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners attached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the XListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the delegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces (\"store\" and \"app\"). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named \"foo\" and one XListenerSet listener named \"second\" as parentRefs. apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Gateway metadata: name: prod-external namespace: infra spec: gatewayClassName: example allowedListeners: - from: All listeners: - name: foo hostname: foo.com protocol: HTTP port: 80 --- apiVersion: gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: XListenerSet metadata: name: store namespace: store spec: parentRef: name: prod-external listeners: - name: first hostname: first.foo.com protocol: HTTPS port: 443 tls: mode: Terminate certificateRefs: - kind: Secret group: \"\" name: first-workload-cert --- apiVersion: gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: XListenerSet metadata: name: app namespace: app spec: parentRef: name: prod-external listeners: - name: second hostname: second.foo.com protocol: HTTPS port: 443 tls: mode: Terminate certificateRefs: - kind: Secret group: \"\" name: second-workload-cert --- apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: httproute-example spec: parentRefs: - name: app kind: XListenerSet sectionName: second - name: parent-gateway kind: Gateway sectionName: foo ... Each listener in a Gateway must have a unique combination of port, protocol, (and hostname if supported by the protocol) in order for all listeners to be compatible and not conflicted over which traffic they should receive. Furthermore, implementations can merge separate Gateways into a single set of listener addresses if all listeners across those Gateways are compatible. The management of merged listeners was under-specified in releases prior to v1.3.0. With the new feature, the specification on merging is expanded. Implementations must treat the parent Gateways as having the merged list of all listeners from itself and from attached XListenerSets, and validation of this list of listeners must behave the same as if the list were part of a single Gateway. Within a single Gateway, listeners are ordered using the following precedence: Single Listeners (not a part of an XListenerSet) first, Remaining listeners ordered by: object creation time (oldest first), and if two listeners are defined in objects that have the same timestamp, then alphabetically based on \"{namespace}/{name of listener}\" Retry budgets (XBackendTrafficPolicy) Leads: Eric Bishop, Mike Morris GEP-3388: Retry Budgets This feature allows you to configure a retry budget across all endpoints of a destination Service. This is used to limit additional client-side retries after reaching a configured threshold. When configuring the budget, the maximum percentage of active requests that may consist of retries may be specified, as well as the interval over which requests will be considered when calculating the threshold for retries. The development of this specification changed the existing experimental API kind BackendLBPolicy into a new experimental API kind, XBackendTrafficPolicy, in the interest of reducing the proliferation of policy resources that had commonalities. To be able to use experimental retry budgets, you need to install the Experimental channel Gateway API XBackendTrafficPolicy yaml. The following example shows an XBackendTrafficPolicy that applies a retryConstraint that represents a budget that limits the retries to a maximum of 20% of requests, over a duration of 10 seconds, and to a minimum of 3 retries over 1 second. apiVersion: gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: XBackendTrafficPolicy metadata: name: traffic-policy-example spec: retryConstraint: budget: percent: 20 interval: 10s minRetryRate: count: 3 interval: 1s ... Try it out Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running Kubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this version of Gateway API. To try out the API, follow the Getting Started Guide. As of this writing, four implementations are already conformant with Gateway API v1.3 experimental channel features. In alphabetical order: Airlock Microgateway 4.6 Cilium main Envoy Gateway v1.4.0 Istio 1.27-dev Get involved Wondering when a feature will be added? There are lots of opportunities to get involved and help define the future of Kubernetes routing APIs for both ingress and service mesh. Check out the user guides to see what use-cases can be addressed. Try out one of the existing Gateway controllers. Or join us in the community and help us build the future of Gateway API together! The maintainers would like to thank everyone who's contributed to Gateway API, whether in the form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general support.

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot; being mirrored to &quot;foo-v2&quot;:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "The Kubernetes project announces that in-place Pod resize feature has moved to Beta and will be included by default in the upcoming v1.",
      "summary_original": "On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the in-place Pod resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. What is in-place Pod resize? Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here's the core idea: The spec.containers[*].resources field in a Pod specification now represents the desired resources and is mutable for CPU and memory. The status.containerStatuses[*].resources field reflects the actual resources currently configured on a running container. You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new resize subresource. You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires kubectl v1.32+): kubectl edit pod <pod-name> --subresource resize For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers. Why does in-place Pod resize matter? Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling: Reduced Disruption: Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart. Improved Resource Utilization: Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart. Faster Scaling: Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later. What's changed between Alpha and Beta? Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes: Notable user-facing changes resize Subresource: Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's resize subresource (kubectl patch pod <name> --subresource resize ...). kubectl versions v1.32+ support this argument. Resize Status via Conditions: The old status.resize field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions: PodResizePending: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., reason: Deferred if temporarily unable, reason: Infeasible if impossible on the node). PodResizeInProgress: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with reason: Error. Sidecar Support: Resizing sidecar containers in-place is now supported. Stability and reliability enhancements Refined Allocated Resources Management: The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize. Improved Checkpointing & State Tracking: A more robust system for tracking \"allocated\" and \"actuated\" resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (allocated_pods_state, actuated_pods_state) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved. Faster Resize Detection: Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly. Enhanced CRI Integration: A new UpdatePodSandboxResources CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes. Numerous Bug Fixes: Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more. What's next? Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next: Stability and Productionization: Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments. Addressing Limitations: Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases. VerticalPodAutoscaler (VPA) Integration: Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new InPlaceOrRecreate update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption. User Feedback: Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs. Getting started and providing feedback With the InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away! Refer to the documentation for detailed guides and examples. As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources for the full in-depth design details. We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!",

          "summary_text": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the <strong>in-place Pod resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to <strong>Beta</strong> and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable.

      "summary": "Kubernetes Job's SuccessPolicy feature has been updated to General Availability in version 1.",
      "summary_original": "On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I'm pleased to announce that Job success policy has graduated to General Availability (GA) as part of the v1.33 release. About Job's Success Policy In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI, in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers' lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn't use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the .spec.successPolicy field (you can only use the .spec.successPolicy field for an indexed Job). Which describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes. This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads. Users in these areas often run numerous experiments and may only need a specific number to complete successfully, rather than requiring all of them to succeed. In this case, the leader index failure is the only relevant Job exit criteria, and the outcomes for individual follower Pods are handled only indirectly via the status of the leader index. Moreover, followers do not know when they can terminate themselves. After Job meets any Success Policy, the Job is marked as succeeded, and all Pods are terminated including the running ones. How it works The following excerpt from a Job manifest, using .successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount, shows an example of using a custom success policy: parallelism: 10 completions: 10 completionMode: Indexed successPolicy: rules: - succeededCount: 1 Here, the Job is marked as succeeded when one index succeeded regardless of its number. Additionally, you can constrain index numbers against succeededCount in .successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount as shown below: parallelism: 10 completions: 10 completionMode: Indexed successPolicy: rules: - succeededIndexes: 0 # index of the leader Pod succeededCount: 1 This example shows that the Job will be marked as succeeded once a Pod with a specific index (Pod index 0) has succeeded. Once the Job either reaches one of the successPolicy rules, or achieves its Complete criteria based on .spec.completions, the Job controller within kube-controller-manager adds the SuccessCriteriaMet condition to the Job status. After that, the job-controller initiates cleanup and termination of Pods for Jobs with SuccessCriteriaMet condition. Eventually, Jobs obtain Complete condition when the job-controller finished cleanup and termination. Learn more Read the documentation for success policy. Read the KEP for the Job success/completion policy Get involved This work was led by the Kubernetes batch working group in close collaboration with the SIG Apps community.

      "summary_original": "Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Zero value for Sleep action Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you'd need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you're using third party images. The sleep action when it was added initially didn't have support for a sleep duration of zero seconds. The time.Sleep which the Sleep action uses under the hood supports a duration of zero seconds. Using a negative or a zero value for the sleep returns immediately, resulting in a no-op. We wanted the same behaviour with the sleep action. This support for the zero duration was later added in v1.32, with the PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature gate. The PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature gate has graduated to beta in v1.33, and is now enabled by default. The original Sleep action for preStop and postStart hooks is been enabled by default, starting from Kubernetes v1.30. With a cluster running Kubernetes v1.33, you are able to set a zero duration for sleep lifecycle hooks. For a cluster with default configuration, you don't need to enable any feature gate to make that possible. Container stop signals Container runtimes such as containerd and CRI-O honor a StopSignal instruction in the container image definition. This can be used to specify a custom stop signal that the runtime will used to terminate containers based on that image. Stop signal configuration was not originally part of the Pod API in Kubernetes. Until Kubernetes v1.33, the only way to override the stop signal for containers was by rebuilding your container image with the new custom stop signal (for example, specifying STOPSIGNAL in a Containerfile or Dockerfile). The ContainerStopSignals feature gate which is newly added in Kubernetes v1.33 adds stop signals to the Kubernetes API. This allows users to specify a custom stop signal in the container spec. Stop signals are added to the API as a new lifecycle along with the existing PreStop and PostStart lifecycle handlers. In order to use this feature, we expect the Pod to have the operating system specified with spec.os.name. This is enforced so that we can cross-validate the stop signal against the operating system and make sure that the containers in the Pod are created with a valid stop signal for the operating system the Pod is being scheduled to. For Pods scheduled on Windows nodes, only SIGTERM and SIGKILL are allowed as valid stop signals. Find the full list of signals supported in Linux nodes here. Default behaviour If a container has a custom stop signal defined in its lifecycle, the container runtime would use the signal defined in the lifecycle to kill the container, given that the container runtime also supports custom stop signals. If there is no custom stop signal defined in the container lifecycle, the runtime would fallback to the stop signal defined in the container image. If there is no stop signal defined in the container image, the default stop signal of the runtime would be used. The default signal is SIGTERM for both containerd and CRI-O. Version skew For the feature to work as intended, both the versions of Kubernetes and the container runtime should support container stop signals. The changes to the Kuberentes API and kubelet are available in alpha stage from v1.33, which can be enabled with the ContainerStopSignals feature gate. The container runtime implementations for containerd and CRI-O are still a work in progress and will be rolled out soon. Using container stop signals To enable this feature, you need to turn on the ContainerStopSignals feature gate in both the kube-apiserver and the kubelet. Once you have nodes where the feature gate is turned on, you can create Pods with a StopSignal lifecycle and a valid OS name like so: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: nginx spec: os: name: linux containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest lifecycle: stopSignal: SIGUSR1 Do note that the SIGUSR1 signal in this example can only be used if the container's Pod is scheduled to a Linux node. Hence we need to specify spec.os.name as linux to be able to use the signal. You will only be able to configure SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals if the Pod is being scheduled to a Windows node. You cannot specify a containers[*].lifecycle.stopSignal if the spec.os.name field is nil or unset either. How do I get involved? This feature is driven by the SIG Node.

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "In Kubernetes v1.33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. About backoff limit per index When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec.backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec.backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes. In order to address this limitation, Kubernetes introduced backoff limit per index, which allows you to control the number of retries per index. How backoff limit per index works To use Backoff Limit Per Index for Indexed Jobs, specify the number of tolerated Pod failures per index with the spec.backoffLimitPerIndex field. When you set this field, the Job executes all indexes by default. Additionally, to fine-tune the error handling: Specify the cap on the total number of failed indexes by setting the spec.maxFailedIndexes field. When the limit is exceeded the entire Job is terminated. Define a short-circuit to detect a failed index by using the FailIndex action in the Pod Failure Policy mechanism. When the number of tolerated failures is exceeded, the Job marks that index as failed and lists it in the Job's status.failedIndexes field. Example The following Job spec snippet is an example of how to combine backoff limit per index with the Pod Failure Policy feature: completions: 10 parallelism: 10 completionMode: Indexed backoffLimitPerIndex: 1 maxFailedIndexes: 5 podFailurePolicy: rules: - action: Ignore onPodConditions: - type: DisruptionTarget - action: FailIndex onExitCodes: operator: In values: [ 42 ] In this example, the Job handles Pod failures as follows: Ignores any failed Pods that have the built-in disruption condition, called DisruptionTarget.

      "summary_original": "Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked! Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. Note:Throughout this blog post, the term \"pod credentials\" will be used often. In this context, the term generally encapsulates the authentication material that is available to a pod to authenticate a container image pull. IfNotPresent, even if I'm not supposed to have it The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let's set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it's image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1, unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy. Pod B does not reference Secret 1 (or in our case, any secret) in its imagePullSecrets. When the Kubelet tries to run the pod, it honors the IfNotPresent policy. The Kubelet sees that the image Foo is already present locally, and will provide image Foo to Pod B. Pod B gets to run the image even though it did not provide credentials authorizing it to pull the image in the first place. Using a private image pulled by a different pod While IfNotPresent should not pull image Foo if it is already present on the node, it is an incorrect security posture to allow all pods scheduled to a node to have access to previously pulled private image. These pods were never authorized to pull the image in the first place. IfNotPresent, but only if I am supposed to have it In Kubernetes v1.33, we - SIG Auth and SIG Node - have finally started to address this (really old) problem and getting the verification right! The basic expected behavior is not changed. If an image is not present, the Kubelet will attempt to pull the image. The credentials each pod supplies will be utilized for this task. This matches behavior prior to 1.33. If the image is present, then the behavior of the Kubelet changes. The Kubelet will now verify the pod's credentials before allowing the pod to use the image. Performance and service stability have been a consideration while revising the feature. Pods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate. This is also true when pods source credentials from the same Kubernetes Secret object, even when the credentials are rotated. Never pull, but use if authorized The imagePullPolicy: Never option does not fetch images. However, if the container image is already present on the node, any pod attempting to use the private image will be required to provide credentials, and those credentials require verification. Pods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate. Pods that do not supply credentials previously used to successfully pull an image will not be allowed to use the private image. Always pull, if authorized The imagePullPolicy: Always has always worked as intended. Each time an image is requested, the request goes to the registry and the registry will perform an authentication check. In the past, forcing the Always image pull policy via pod admission was the only way to ensure that your private container images didn't get reused by other pods on nodes which already pulled the images. Fortunately, this was somewhat performant. Only the image manifest was pulled, not the image. However, there was still a cost and a risk. During a new rollout, scale up, or pod restart, the image registry that provided the image MUST be available for the auth check, putting the image registry in the critical path for stability of services running inside of the cluster. How it all works The feature is based on persistent, file-based caches that are present on each of the nodes. The following is a simplified description of how the feature works. For the complete version, please see KEP-2535. The process of requesting an image for the first time goes like this: A pod requesting an image from a private registry is scheduled to a node. The image is not present on the node. The Kubelet makes a record of the intention to pull the image. The Kubelet extracts credentials from the Kubernetes Secret referenced by the pod as an image pull secret, and uses them to pull the image from the private registry. After the image has been successfully pulled, the Kubelet makes a record of the successful pull. This record includes details about credentials used (in the form of a hash) as well as the Secret from which they originated. The Kubelet removes the original record of intent. The Kubelet retains the record of successful pull for later use. When future pods scheduled to the same node request the previously pulled private image: The Kubelet checks the credentials that the new pod provides for the pull. If the hash of these credentials, or the source Secret of the credentials match the hash or source Secret which were recorded for a previous successful pull, the pod is allowed to use the previously pulled image. If the credentials or their source Secret are not found in the records of successful pulls for that image, the Kubelet will attempt to use these new credentials to request a pull from the remote registry, triggering the authorization flow. Try it out In Kubernetes v1.33 we shipped the alpha version of this feature. To give it a spin, enable the KubeletEnsureSecretPulledImages feature gate for your 1.33 Kubelets. You can learn more about the feature and additional optional configuration on the concept page for Images in the official Kubernetes documentation. What's next? In future releases we are going to: Make this feature work together with Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers which adds a new, workload-specific source of image pull credentials. Write a benchmarking suite to measure the performance of this feature and assess the impact of any future changes. Implement an in-memory caching layer so that we don't need to read files for each image pull request. Add support for credential expirations, thus forcing previously validated credentials to be re-authenticated. How to get involved Reading KEP-2535 is a great way to understand these changes in depth. If you are interested in further involvement, reach out to us on the #sig-auth-authenticators-dev channel on Kubernetes Slack (for an invitation, visit https://slack.k8s.io/). You are also welcome to join the bi-weekly SIG Auth meetings, held every other Wednesday.",

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/09/kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/",
      "summary": "The Kubernetes community introduces streaming encoding for List responses to address memory consumption issues in large-scale cluster operations.",
      "summary_original": "Managing Kubernetes cluster stability becomes increasingly critical as your infrastructure grows. One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster's stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. The problem: unnecessary memory consumption with large resources Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter.Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2's capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body\u2019s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability. The encoding/json package uses sync.Pool to reuse memory buffers during serialization. While efficient for consistent workloads, this mechanism creates challenges with sporadic large List responses. When processing these large responses, memory pools expand significantly. But due to sync.Pool's design, these oversized buffers remain reserved after use. Subsequent small List requests continue utilizing these large memory allocations, preventing garbage collection and maintaining persistently high memory consumption in the kube-apiserver even after the initial large responses complete. Additionally, Protocol Buffers are not designed to handle large datasets. But it\u2019s great for handling individual messages within a large data set. This highlights the need for streaming-based approaches that can process and transmit large collections incrementally rather than as monolithic blocks. As a general rule of thumb, if you are dealing in messages larger than a megabyte each, it may be time to consider an alternate strategy. From https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/techniques/ Streaming encoder for List responses The streaming encoding mechanism is specifically designed for List responses, leveraging their common well-defined collection structures. The core idea focuses exclusively on the Items field within collection structures, which represents the bulk of memory consumption in large responses. Rather than encoding the entire Items array as one contiguous memory block, the new streaming encoder processes and transmits each item individually, allowing memory to be freed progressively as frame or chunk is transmitted. As a result, encoding items one by one significantly reduces the memory footprint required by the API server. With Kubernetes objects typically limited to 1.5 MiB (from ETCD), streaming encoding keeps memory consumption predictable and manageable regardless of how many objects are in a List response. The result is significantly improved API server stability, reduced memory spikes, and better overall cluster performance - especially in environments where multiple large List operations might occur simultaneously. To ensure perfect backward compatibility, the streaming encoder validates Go struct tags rigorously before activation, guaranteeing byte-for-byte consistency with the original encoder. Standard encoding mechanisms process all fields except Items, maintaining identical output formatting throughout. This approach seamlessly supports all Kubernetes List types\u2014from built-in *List objects to Custom Resource UnstructuredList objects - requiring zero client-side modifications or awareness that the underlying encoding method has changed. Performance gains you'll notice Reduced Memory Consumption: Significantly lowers the memory footprint of the API server when handling large list requests, especially when dealing with large resources. Improved Scalability: Enables the API server to handle more concurrent requests and larger datasets without running out of memory. Increased Stability: Reduces the risk of OOM kills and service disruptions. Efficient Resource Utilization: Optimizes memory usage and improves overall resource efficiency.

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)! The AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is treated as always enabled for Kubernetes v1.33, which means that users can specify any appropriate custom resource as the data source of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of how to use dataSourceRef in PVC: apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc1 spec: ... dataSourceRef: apiGroup: provider.example.com kind: Provider name: provider1 What is new There are four major enhancements from beta. Populator Pod is optional During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc.) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we've introduced three new plugin-based functions: PopulateFn(): Executes the provider-specific data population logic. PopulateCompleteFn(): Checks if the data population operation has finished successfully. PopulateCleanupFn(): Cleans up temporary resources created by the provider-specific functions after data population is completed A provider example is added in lib-volume-populator/example. Mutator functions to modify the Kubernetes resources For GA, the CSI volume populator controller code gained a MutatorConfig, allowing the specification of mutator functions to modify Kubernetes resources. For example, if the PVC prime is not an exact copy of the PVC and you need provider-specific information for the driver, you can include this information in the optional MutatorConfig. This allows you to customize the Kubernetes objects in the volume populator. Flexible metric handling for providers Our beta phase highlighted a new requirement: the need to aggregate metrics not just from lib-volume-populator, but also from other components within the provider's codebase. To address this, SIG Storage introduced a provider metric manager. This enhancement delegates the implementation of metrics logic to the provider itself, rather than relying solely on lib-volume-populator. This shift provides greater flexibility and control over metrics collection and aggregation, enabling a more comprehensive view of provider performance. Clean up for temporary resources During the beta phase, we identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress, due to limitations in finalizer handling. We have improved the populator to support the deletion of temporary resources (PVC prime, etc.) if the original PVC is deleted in this GA release. How to use it To try it out, please follow the steps in the previous beta blog. Future directions and potential feature requests For next step, there are several potential feature requests for volume populator: Multi sync: the current implementation is a one-time unidirectional sync from source to destination. This can be extended to support multiple syncs, enabling periodic syncs or allowing users to sync on demand Bidirectional sync: an extension of multi sync above, but making it bidirectional between source and destination Populate data with priorities: with a list of different dataSourceRef, populate based on priorities Populate data from multiple sources of the same provider: populate multiple different sources to one destination Populate data from multiple sources of the different providers: populate multiple different sources to one destination, pipelining different resources\u2019 population To ensure we're building something truly valuable, Kubernetes SIG Storage would love to hear about any specific use cases you have in mind for this feature. For any inquiries or specific questions related to volume populator, please reach out to the SIG Storage community.",

      "summary": "Kubernetes has evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials for authentication processes.",
      "summary_original": "Kubernetes has steadily evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials stored in the API. A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers, now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls \u2014 eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. The problem with image pull secrets Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API These secrets are often long-lived because they are hard to rotate. They must be explicitly attached to a service account or pod. Compromise of a pull secret can lead to unauthorized image access. Kubelet credential providers These providers fetch credentials dynamically at the node level. Any pod running on the node can access the same credentials. There\u2019s no per-workload isolation, increasing security risks. Neither approach aligns with the principles of least privilege or ephemeral authentication, leaving Kubernetes with a security gap. The solution: Service Account token integration for Kubelet credential providers This new enhancement enables kubelet credential providers to use workload identity when fetching image registry credentials. Instead of relying on long-lived secrets, credential providers can use service account tokens to request short-lived credentials tied to a specific pod\u2019s identity. This approach provides: Workload-specific authentication: Image pull credentials are scoped to a particular workload. Ephemeral credentials: Tokens are automatically rotated, eliminating the risks of long-lived secrets. Seamless integration: Works with existing Kubernetes authentication mechanisms, aligning with cloud-native security best practices. How it works 1. Service Account tokens for credential providers Kubelet generates short-lived, automatically rotated tokens for service accounts if the credential provider it communicates with has opted into receiving a service account token for image pulls. These tokens conform to OIDC ID token semantics and are provided to the credential provider as part of the CredentialProviderRequest. The credential provider can then use this token to authenticate with an external service. 2. Image registry authentication flow When a pod starts, the kubelet requests credentials from a credential provider. If the credential provider has opted in, the kubelet generates a service account token for the pod. The service account token is included in the CredentialProviderRequest, allowing the credential provider to authenticate and exchange it for temporary image pull credentials from a registry (e.g. AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, Azure ACR). The kubelet then uses these credentials to pull images on behalf of the pod. Benefits of this approach Security: Eliminates long-lived image pull secrets, reducing attack surfaces. Granular Access Control: Credentials are tied to individual workloads rather than entire nodes or clusters. Operational Simplicity: No need for administrators to manage and rotate image pull secrets manually. Improved Compliance: Helps organizations meet security policies that prohibit persistent credentials in the cluster. What's next? For Kubernetes v1.34, we expect to ship this feature in beta while continuing to gather feedback from users. In the coming releases, we will focus on: Implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance for token generation. Giving more flexibility to credential providers to decide how the registry credentials returned to the kubelet are cached. Making the feature work with Ensure Secret Pulled Images to ensure pods that use an image are authorized to access that image when service account tokens are used for authentication. You can learn more about this feature on the service account token for image pulls page in the Kubernetes documentation. You can also follow along on the KEP-4412 to track progress across the coming Kubernetes releases. Try it out To try out this feature: Ensure you are running Kubernetes v1.33 or later. Enable the ServiceAccountTokenForKubeletCredentialProviders feature gate on the kubelet. Ensure credential provider support: Modify or update your credential provider to use service account tokens for authentication. Update the credential provider configuration to opt into receiving service account tokens for the credential provider by configuring the tokenAttributes field. Deploy a pod that uses the credential provider to pull images from a private registry. We would love to hear your feedback on this feature. Please reach out to us on the #sig-auth-authenticators-dev channel on Kubernetes Slack (for an invitation, visit https://slack.k8s.io/). How to get involved If you are interested in getting involved in the development of this feature, sharing feedback, or participating in any other ongoing SIG Auth projects, please reach out on the #sig-auth channel on Kubernetes Slack.

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "The new field, supplementalGroupsPolicy, was introduced as an opt-in alpha feature for Kubernetes v1.31 and has graduated to beta in v1.33; the corresponding feature gate (SupplementalGroupsPolicy) is now enabled by default. This feature enables to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in containers that can strengthen the security posture, particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. Please be aware that this beta release contains some behavioral breaking change. See The Behavioral Changes Introduced In Beta and Upgrade Considerations sections for details. Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image Although the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. Let's see an example, below Pod manifest specifies runAsUser=1000, runAsGroup=3000 and supplementalGroups=4000 in the Pod's security context. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: implicit-groups spec: securityContext: runAsUser: 1000 runAsGroup: 3000 supplementalGroups: [4000] containers: - name: ctr image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.45 command: [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 1h\" ] securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false What is the result of id command in the ctr container? The output should be similar to this: uid=1000 gid=3000 groups=3000,4000,50000 Where does group ID 50000 in supplementary groups (groups field) come from, even though 50000 is not defined in the Pod's manifest at all? The answer is /etc/group file in the container image. Checking the contents of /etc/group in the container image should show below: user-defined-in-image:x:1000: group-defined-in-image:x:50000:user-defined-in-image This shows that the container's primary user 1000 belongs to the group 50000 in the last entry. Thus, the group membership defined in /etc/group in the container image for the container's primary user is implicitly merged to the information from the Pod. Please note that this was a design decision the current CRI implementations inherited from Docker, and the community never really reconsidered it until now. What's wrong with it? The implicitly merged group information from /etc/group in the container image poses a security risk. These implicit GIDs can't be detected or validated by policy engines because there's no record of them in the Pod manifest. This can lead to unexpected access control issues, particularly when accessing volumes (see kubernetes/kubernetes#112879 for details) because file permission is controlled by UID/GIDs in Linux. Fine-grained supplemental groups control in a Pod: supplementaryGroupsPolicy To tackle the above problem, Pod's .spec.securityContext now includes supplementalGroupsPolicy field. This field lets you control how Kubernetes calculates the supplementary groups for container processes within a Pod. The available policies are: Merge: The group membership defined in /etc/group for the container's primary user will be merged. If not specified, this policy will be applied (i.e. as-is behavior for backward compatibility). Strict: Only the group IDs specified in fsGroup, supplementalGroups, or runAsGroup are attached as supplementary groups to the container processes. Group memberships defined in /etc/group for the container's primary user are ignored. Let's see how Strict policy works. Below Pod manifest specifies supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: strict-supplementalgroups-policy spec: securityContext: runAsUser: 1000 runAsGroup: 3000 supplementalGroups: [4000] supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict containers: - name: ctr image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.45 command: [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 1h\" ] securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false The result of id command in the ctr container should be similar to this: uid=1000 gid=3000 groups=3000,4000 You can see Strict policy can exclude group 50000 from groups! Thus, ensuring supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict (enforced by some policy mechanism) helps prevent the implicit supplementary groups in a Pod. Note:A container with sufficient privileges can change its process identity. The supplementalGroupsPolicy only affect the initial process identity. See the following section for details. Attached process identity in Pod status This feature also exposes the process identity attached to the first container process of the container via .status.containerStatuses[].user.linux field. It would be helpful to see if implicit group IDs are attached. ... status: containerStatuses: - name: ctr user: linux: gid: 3000 supplementalGroups: - 3000 - 4000 uid: 1000 ... Note:Please note that the values in status.containerStatuses[].user.linux field is the firstly attached process identity to the first container process in the container. If the container has sufficient privilege to call system calls related to process identity (e.g. setuid(2), setgid(2) or setgroups(2), etc.), the container process can change its identity. Thus, the actual process identity will be dynamic. Strict Policy requires newer CRI versions Actually, CRI runtime (e.g. containerd, CRI-O) plays a core role for calculating supplementary group ids to be attached to the containers. Thus, SupplementalGroupsPolicy=Strict requires a CRI runtime that support this feature (SupplementalGroupsPolicy: Merge can work with the CRI runtime which does not support this feature because this policy is fully backward compatible policy). Here are some CRI runtimes that support this feature, and the versions you need to be running: containerd: v2.0 or later CRI-O: v1.31 or later And, you can see if the feature is supported in the Node's .status.features.supplementalGroupsPolicy field. apiVersion: v1 kind: Node ... status: features: supplementalGroupsPolicy: true The behavioral changes introduced in beta In the alpha release, when a Pod with supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict was scheduled to a node that did not support the feature (i.e., .status.features.supplementalGroupsPolicy=false), the Pod's supplemental groups policy silently fell back to Merge. In v1.33, this has entered beta to enforce the policy more strictly, where kubelet rejects pods whose nodes cannot ensure the specified policy. If your pod is rejected, you will see warning events with reason=SupplementalGroupsPolicyNotSupported like below: apiVersion: v1 kind: Event ... type: Warning reason: SupplementalGroupsPolicyNotSupported message: \"SupplementalGroupsPolicy=Strict is not supported in this node\" involvedObject: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod ... Upgrade consideration If you're already using this feature, especially the supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict policy, we assume that your cluster's CRI runtimes already support this feature. In that case, you don't need to worry about the pod rejections described above. However, if your cluster: uses the supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict policy, but its CRI runtimes do NOT yet support the feature (i.e., .status.features.supplementalGroupsPolicy=false), you need to prepare the behavioral changes (pod rejection) when upgrading your cluster. We recommend several ways to avoid unexpected pod rejections: Upgrading your cluster's CRI runtimes together with kubernetes or before the upgrade Putting some label to your nodes describing CRI runtime supports this feature or not and also putting label selector to pods with Strict policy to select such nodes (but, you will need to monitor the number of Pending pods in this case instead of pod rejections). Getting involved This feature is driven by the SIG Node community. Please join us to connect with the community and share your ideas and feedback around the above feature and beyond. We look forward to hearing from you! How can I learn more?

      "summary_original": "I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases? PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user's request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. PV reclaim policy with Kubernetes v1.33 With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.33, this issue is now resolved. Kubernetes now reliably honors the configured Delete reclaim policy, even when PVs are deleted before their bound PVCs. This is achieved through the use of finalizers, ensuring that the storage backend releases the allocated storage resource as intended. How does it work? For CSI volumes, the new behavior is achieved by adding a finalizer external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer on new and existing PVs. The finalizer is only removed after the storage from the backend is deleted. Addition or removal of finalizer is handled by external-provisioner ` An example of a PV with the finalizer, notice the new finalizer in the finalizers list kubectl get pv pvc-a7b7e3ba-f837-45ba-b243-dec7d8aaed53 -o yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: annotations: pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: csi.example.driver.com creationTimestamp: \"2021-11-17T19:28:56Z\" finalizers: - kubernetes.io/pv-protection - external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer name: pvc-a7b7e3ba-f837-45ba-b243-dec7d8aaed53 resourceVersion: \"194711\" uid: 087f14f2-4157-4e95-8a70-8294b039d30e spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 1Gi claimRef: apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim name: example-vanilla-block-pvc namespace: default resourceVersion: \"194677\" uid: a7b7e3ba-f837-45ba-b243-dec7d8aaed53 csi: driver: csi.example.driver.com fsType: ext4 volumeAttributes: storage.kubernetes.io/csiProvisionerIdentity: 1637110610497-8081-csi.example.driver.com type: CNS Block Volume volumeHandle: 2dacf297-803f-4ccc-afc7-3d3c3f02051e persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete storageClassName: example-vanilla-block-sc volumeMode: Filesystem status: phase: Bound The finalizer prevents this PersistentVolume from being removed from the cluster. As stated previously, the finalizer is only removed from the PV object after it is successfully deleted from the storage backend. To learn more about finalizers, please refer to Using Finalizers to Control Deletion. Similarly, the finalizer kubernetes.io/pv-controller is added to dynamically provisioned in-tree plugin volumes. Important note The fix does not apply to statically provisioned in-tree plugin volumes. How to enable new behavior? To take advantage of the new behavior, you must have upgraded your cluster to the v1.33 release of Kubernetes and run the CSI external-provisioner version 5.0.1 or later. The feature was released as beta in v1.31 release of Kubernetes, where it was enabled by default. References KEP-2644 Volume leak issue Beta Release Blog How do I get involved?

          "summary_text": "<p>I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/\">PersistentVolume</a> (or PVs for short)\nleaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in\nKubernetes v1.33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta\nfeature in Kubernetes v1.31, ensures that your storage resources are properly\nreclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-did-reclaim-work-in-previous-kubernetes-releases\">How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#Introduction\">PersistentVolumeClaim</a> (or PVC for short) is\na user's request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#Binding\">Bound</a>\nif a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are\nbacked by volumes allocated by the storage backend.</p>\n<p>Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the\nPVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV\nbefore deleting a PVC.</p>\n<p>For a <code>Bound</code> PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether\nthe PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is\ndeleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the\nreclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated\nstorage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pv-reclaim-policy-with-kubernetes-v1-33\">PV reclaim policy with Kubernetes v1.33</h2>\n<p>With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.33, this issue is now resolved. Kubernetes\nnow reliably honors the configured <code>Delete</code> reclaim policy, even when PVs are deleted\nbefore their bound PVCs. This is achieved through the use of finalizers,\nensuring that the storage backend releases the allocated storage resource as intended.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h3>\n<p>For CSI volumes, the new behavior is achieved by adding a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/\">finalizer</a> <code>external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer</code>\non new and existing PVs. The finalizer is only removed after the storage from the backend is deleted. Addition or removal of finalizer is handled by <code>external-provisioner</code>\n`</p>\n<p>An example of a PV with the finalizer, notice the new finalizer in the finalizers list</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>kubectl get pv pvc-a7b7e3ba-f837-45ba-b243-dec7d8aaed53 -o yaml\n</code></pre><div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "Scheduling stateful applications reliably depends heavily on accurate information about resource availability on nodes. Kubernetes v1.33 introduces an alpha feature called mutable CSI node allocatable count, allowing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information. Background Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node's lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control. Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc.) consuming available slots. Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver\u2019s operations affect available capacity reported by another. Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don't, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. Dynamically adapting CSI volume limits With the new feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount, Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler has the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. How it works When this feature is enabled, Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: Periodic Updates: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node's allocatable capacity. Reactive Updates: An immediate update triggered when a volume attachment fails due to exhausted resources (ResourceExhausted error). Enabling the feature To use this alpha feature, you must enable the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate in these components: kube-apiserver kubelet Example CSI driver configuration Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds: apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 kind: CSIDriver metadata: name: example.csi.k8s.io spec: nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds: 60 This configuration directs Kubelet to periodically call the CSI driver's NodeGetInfo method every 60 seconds, updating the node\u2019s allocatable volume count. Kubernetes enforces a minimum update interval of 10 seconds to balance accuracy and resource usage. Immediate updates on attachment failures In addition to periodic updates, Kubernetes now reacts to attachment failures. Specifically, if a volume attachment fails with a ResourceExhausted error (gRPC code 8), an immediate update is triggered to correct the allocatable count promptly. This proactive correction prevents repeated scheduling errors and helps maintain cluster health. Getting started To experiment with mutable CSI node allocatable count in your Kubernetes v1.33 cluster: Enable the feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount on the kube-apiserver and kubelet components. Update your CSI driver configuration by setting nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds. Monitor and observe improvements in scheduling accuracy and pod placement reliability. Next steps This feature is currently in alpha and the Kubernetes community welcomes your feedback. Test it, share your experiences, and help guide its evolution toward beta and GA stability. Join discussions in the Kubernetes Storage Special Interest Group (SIG-Storage) to shape the future of Kubernetes storage capabilities.",

      "summary_original": "Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha feature in the v1.26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for Kubernetes v1.31. The main DRA feature went to beta in v1.32, and the project hopes it will be generally available in Kubernetes v1.34. The basic feature set of DRA provides a far more powerful and flexible API for requesting devices than Device Plugin. And while DRA remains a beta feature for v1.33, the DRA team has been hard at work implementing a number of new features and UX improvements. One feature has been promoted to beta, while a number of new features have been added in alpha. The team has also made progress towards getting DRA ready for GA. Features promoted to beta Driver-owned Resource Claim Status was promoted to beta. This allows the driver to report driver-specific device status data for each allocated device in a resource claim, which is particularly useful for supporting network devices. New alpha features Partitionable Devices lets a driver advertise several overlapping logical devices (\u201cpartitions\u201d), and the driver can reconfigure the physical device dynamically based on the actual devices allocated. This makes it possible to partition devices on-demand to meet the needs of the workloads and therefore increase the utilization. Device Taints and Tolerations allow devices to be tainted and for workloads to tolerate those taints. This makes it possible for drivers or cluster administrators to mark devices as unavailable. Depending on the effect of the taint, this can prevent devices from being allocated or cause eviction of pods that are using the device. Prioritized List lets users specify a list of acceptable devices for their workloads, rather than just a single type of device. So while the workload might run best on a single high-performance GPU, it might also be able to run on 2 mid-level GPUs. The scheduler will attempt to satisfy the alternatives in the list in order, so the workload will be allocated the best set of devices available in the cluster. Admin Access has been updated so that only users with access to a namespace with the resource.k8s.io/admin-access: \"true\" label are authorized to create ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplates objects with the adminAccess field within the namespace. This grants administrators access to in-use devices and may enable additional permissions when making the device available in a container. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the feature. Preparing for general availability A new v1beta2 API has been added to simplify the user experience and to prepare for additional features being added in the future. The RBAC rules for DRA have been improved and support has been added for seamless upgrades of DRA drivers. What\u2019s next? The plan for v1.34 is even more ambitious than for v1.33. Most importantly, we (the Kubernetes device management working group) hope to bring DRA to general availability, which will make it available by default on all v1.34 Kubernetes clusters. This also means that many, perhaps all, of the DRA features that are still beta in v1.34 will become enabled by default, making it much easier to use them. The alpha features that were added in v1.33 will be brought to beta in v1.34. Getting involved A good starting point is joining the WG Device Management Slack channel and meetings, which happen at US/EU and EU/APAC friendly time slots. Not all enhancement ideas are tracked as issues yet, so come talk to us if you want to help or have some ideas yourself! We have work to do at all levels, from difficult core changes to usability enhancements in kubectl, which could be picked up by newcomers.

This also means that many, perhaps all, of the DRA features that are still beta in v1.34 will become enabled by default, making it much easier to use them.</p>\n<p>The alpha features that were added in v1.33 will be brought to beta in v1.34.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h3>\n<p>A good starting point is joining the WG Device Management <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0409NGC1TK\">Slack channel</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxI87VqGtgN7EAJlqVfxx86HGKEAc2A3SKru8nJHNkQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tgg8gganowxq\">meetings</a>, which happen at US/EU and EU/APAC friendly time slots.</p>\n<p>Not all enhancement ideas are tracked as issues yet, so come talk to us if you want to help or have some ideas yourself!

      "summary_original": "Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a new alpha feature called StorageCapacityScoring. This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity. About this feature This feature extends the kube-scheduler's VolumeBinding plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage capacity. So, you have to use a scheduler extender to achieve storage-capacity-based pod scheduling. This feature is useful for provisioning node-local PVs, which have size limits based on the node's storage capacity. By using this feature, you can assign the PVs to the nodes with the most available storage space so that you can expand the PVs later as much as possible. In another use case, you might want to reduce the number of nodes as much as possible for low operation costs in cloud environments by choosing the least storage capacity node. This feature helps maximize resource utilization by filling up nodes more sequentially, starting with the most utilized nodes first that still have enough storage capacity for the requested volume size. How to use Enabling the feature In the alpha phase, StorageCapacityScoring is disabled by default. To use this feature, add StorageCapacityScoring=true to the kube-scheduler command line option --feature-gates. Configuration changes You can configure node priorities based on storage utilization using the shape parameter in the VolumeBinding plugin configuration. This allows you to prioritize nodes with higher available storage capacity (default) or, conversely, nodes with lower available storage capacity. For example, to prioritize lower available storage capacity, configure KubeSchedulerConfiguration as follows: apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1 kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration profiles: ... pluginConfig: - name: VolumeBinding args: ... shape: - utilization: 0 score: 0 - utilization: 100 score: 10 For more details, please refer to the documentation. Further reading KEP-4049: Storage Capacity Scoring of Nodes for Dynamic Provisioning Additional note: Relationship with VolumeCapacityPriority The alpha feature gate VolumeCapacityPriority, which performs node scoring based on available storage capacity during static provisioning, will be deprecated and replaced by StorageCapacityScoring. Please note that while VolumeCapacityPriority prioritizes nodes with lower available storage capacity by default, StorageCapacityScoring prioritizes nodes with higher available storage capacity by default.",

      "summary": "Kubernetes Image Volumes advance to beta status in version 1.",
      "summary_original": "Image Volumes were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes v1.31 release as part of KEP-4639. In Kubernetes v1.33, this feature graduates to beta. Please note that the feature is still disabled by default, because not all container runtimes have full support for it. CRI-O supports the initial feature since version v1.31 and will add support for Image Volumes as beta in v1.33. containerd merged support for the alpha feature which will be part of the v2.1.0 release and is working on beta support as part of PR #11578. What's new The major change for the beta graduation of Image Volumes is the support for subPath and subPathExpr mounts for containers via spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.[subPath,subPathExpr]. This allows end-users to mount a certain subdirectory of an image volume, which is still mounted as readonly (noexec). This means that non-existing subdirectories cannot be mounted by default. As for other subPath and subPathExpr values, Kubernetes will ensure that there are no absolute path or relative path components part of the specified sub path. Container runtimes are also required to double check those requirements for safety reasons. If a specified subdirectory does not exist within a volume, then runtimes should fail on container creation and provide user feedback by using existing kubelet events. Besides that, there are also three new kubelet metrics available for image volumes: kubelet_image_volume_requested_total: Outlines the number of requested image volumes. kubelet_image_volume_mounted_succeed_total: Counts the number of successful image volume mounts. kubelet_image_volume_mounted_errors_total: Accounts the number of failed image volume mounts. To use an existing subdirectory for a specific image volume, just use it as subPath (or subPathExpr) value of the containers volumeMounts: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: image-volume spec: containers: - name: shell command: [\"sleep\", \"infinity\"] image: debian volumeMounts: - name: volume mountPath: /volume subPath: dir volumes: - name: volume image: reference: quay.io/crio/artifact:v2 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent Then, create the pod on your cluster: kubectl apply -f image-volumes-subpath.yaml Now you can attach to the container: kubectl attach -it image-volume bash And check the content of the file from the dir sub path in the volume: cat /volume/file The output will be similar to: 1 Thank you for reading through the end of this blog post!

      "summary_original": "In Kubernetes v1.33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default. This means that, when the stack requirements are met, pods can opt-in to use user namespaces. To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature flag anymore! In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But, before we dive into that, let's recap what user namespaces are and why they are important. What is a user namespace? Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes namespaces. The former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature. Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes. One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. It isolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs. Furthermore, the identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged, non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on the host. This brings three key benefits: Prevention of lateral movement: As the UIDs and GIDs for different containers are mapped to different UIDs and GIDs on the host, containers have a harder time attacking each other, even if they escape the container boundaries. For example, suppose container A runs with different UIDs and GIDs on the host than container B. In that case, the operations it can do on container B's files and processes are limited: only read/write what a file allows to others, as it will never have permission owner or group permission (the UIDs/GIDs on the host are guaranteed to be different for different containers). Increased host isolation: As the UIDs and GIDs are mapped to unprivileged users on the host, if a container escapes the container boundaries, even if it runs as root inside the container, it has no privileges on the host. This greatly protects what host files it can read/write, which process it can send signals to, etc. Furthermore, capabilities granted are only valid inside the user namespace and not on the host, limiting the impact a container escape can have. Enablement of new use cases: User namespaces allow containers to gain certain capabilities inside their own user namespace without affecting the host. This unlocks new possibilities, such as running applications that require privileged operations without granting full root access on the host. This is particularly useful for running nested containers. User namespace IDs allocation If a pod running as the root user without a user namespace manages to breakout, it has root privileges on the node. If some capabilities were granted to the container, the capabilities are valid on the host too. None of this is true when using user namespaces (modulo bugs, of course \ud83d\ude42). Demos Rodrigo created demos to understand how some CVEs are mitigated when user namespaces are used. We showed them here before (see here and here), but take a look if you haven't: Mitigation of CVE 2024-21626 with user namespaces: Mitigation of CVE 2022-0492 with user namespaces: Everything you wanted to know about user namespaces in Kubernetes Here we try to answer some of the questions we have been asked about user namespaces support in Kubernetes. 1. What are the requirements to use it? The requirements are documented here. But we will elaborate a bit more, in the following questions. Note this is a Linux-only feature. 2. How do I configure a pod to opt-in? A complete step-by-step guide is available here. But the short version is you need to set the hostUsers: false field in the pod spec. For example like this: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: userns spec: hostUsers: false containers: - name: shell command: [\"sleep\", \"infinity\"] image: debian Yes, it is that simple. Applications will run just fine, without any other changes needed (unless your application needs the privileges). User namespaces allows you to run as root inside the container, but not have privileges in the host. However, if your application needs the privileges on the host, for example an app that needs to load a kernel module, then you can't use user namespaces. 3. What are idmap mounts and why the file-systems used need to support it? Idmap mounts are a Linux kernel feature that uses a mapping of UIDs/GIDs when accessing a mount. When combined with user namespaces, it greatly simplifies the support for volumes, as you can forget about the host UIDs/GIDs the user namespace is using. In particular, thanks to idmap mounts we can: Run each pod with different UIDs/GIDs on the host. This is key for the lateral movement prevention we mentioned earlier. Share volumes with pods that don't use user namespaces. Enable/disable user namespaces without needing to chown the pod's volumes. Support for idmap mounts in the kernel is per file-system and different kernel releases added support for idmap mounts on different file-systems. To find which kernel version added support for each file-system, you can check out the mount_setattr man page, or the online version of it here. Most popular file-systems are supported, the notable absence that isn't supported yet is NFS. 4. Can you clarify exactly which file-systems need to support idmap mounts? The file-systems that need to support idmap mounts are all the file-systems used by a pod in the pod.spec.volumes field. This means: for PV/PVC volumes, the file-system used in the PV needs to support idmap mounts; for hostPath volumes, the file-system used in the hostPath needs to support idmap mounts. What does this mean for secrets/configmaps/projected/downwardAPI volumes? For these volumes, the kubelet creates a tmpfs file-system. So, you will need a 6.3 kernel to use these volumes (note that if you use them as env variables it is fine). And what about emptyDir volumes? Those volumes are created by the kubelet by default in /var/lib/kubelet/pods/. You can also use a custom directory for this. But what needs to support idmap mounts is the file-system used in that directory. The kubelet creates some more files for the container, like /etc/hostname, /etc/resolv.conf, /dev/termination-log, /etc/hosts, etc. These files are also created in /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ by default, so it's important for the file-system used in that directory to support idmap mounts. Also, some container runtimes may put some of these ephemeral volumes inside a tmpfs file-system, in which case you will need support for idmap mounts in tmpfs. 5. Can I use a kernel older than 6.3? Yes, but you will need to make sure you are not using a tmpfs file-system. If you avoid that, you can easily use 5.19 (if all the other file-systems you use support idmap mounts in that kernel). It can be tricky to avoid using tmpfs, though, as we just described above. Besides having to avoid those volume types, you will also have to avoid mounting the service account token. Every pod has it mounted by default, and it uses a projected volume that, as we mentioned, uses a tmpfs file-system. You could even go lower than 5.19, all the way to 5.12. However, your container rootfs probably uses an overlayfs file-system, and support for overlayfs was added in 5.19. We wouldn't recommend to use a kernel older than 5.19, as not being able to use idmap mounts for the rootfs is a big limitation. If you absolutely need to, you can check this blog post Rodrigo wrote some years ago, about tricks to use user namespaces when you can't support idmap mounts on the rootfs. 6. If my stack supports user namespaces, do I need to configure anything else? No, if your stack supports it and you are using Kubernetes v1.33, there is nothing you need to configure. You should be able to follow the task: Use a user namespace with a pod. However, in case you have specific requirements, you may configure various options. You can find more information here. You can also enable a feature gate to relax the PSS rules. 7. The demos are nice, but are there more CVEs that this mitigates? Yes, quite a lot, actually! Besides the ones in the demo, the KEP has more CVEs you can check. That list is not exhaustive, there are many more. 8. Can you sum up why user namespaces is important? Think about running a process as root, maybe even an untrusted process. Do you think that is secure? What if we limit it by adding seccomp and apparmor, mask some files in /proc (so it can't crash the node, etc.) and some more tweaks? Wouldn't it be better if we don't give it privileges in the first place, instead of trying to play whack-a-mole with all the possible ways root can escape? This is what user namespaces does, plus some other goodies: Run as an unprivileged user on the host without making changes to your application. Greg and Vinayak did a great talk on the pains you can face when trying to run unprivileged without user namespaces. The pains part starts in this minute. All pods run with different UIDs/GIDs, we significantly improve the lateral movement. This is guaranteed with user namespaces (the kubelet chooses it for you). In the same talk, Greg and Vinayak show that to achieve the same without user namespaces, they went through a quite complex custom solution. This part starts in this minute. The capabilities granted are only granted inside the user namespace. That means that if a pod breaks out of the container, they are not valid on the host. We can't provide that without user namespaces. It enables new use-cases in a secure way. You can run docker in docker, unprivileged container builds, Kubernetes inside Kubernetes, etc all in a secure way. Most of the previous solutions to do this required privileged containers or putting the node at a high risk of compromise. 9. Is there container runtime documentation for user namespaces? Yes, we have containerd documentation. This explains different limitations of containerd 1.7 and how to use user namespaces in containerd without Kubernetes pods (using ctr). Note that if you use containerd, you need containerd 2.0 or higher to use user namespaces with Kubernetes. CRI-O doesn't have special documentation for user namespaces, it works out of the box. 10. What about the other container runtimes? No other container runtime that we are aware of supports user namespaces with Kubernetes. That sadly includes cri-dockerd too. 11. I'd like to learn more about it, what would you recommend? Rodrigo did an introduction to user namespaces at KubeCon 2022: Run As \u201cRoot\u201d, Not Root: User Namespaces In K8s- Marga Manterola, Isovalent & Rodrigo Campos Catelin Also, this aforementioned presentation at KubeCon 2023 can be useful as a motivation for user namespaces: Least Privilege Containers: Keeping a Bad Day from Getting Worse - Greg Castle & Vinayak Goyal Bear in mind the presentation are some years old, some things have changed since then. Use the Kubernetes documentation as the source of truth. If you would like to learn more about the low-level details of user namespaces, you can check man 7 user_namespaces and man 1 unshare. You can easily create namespaces and experiment with how they behave. Be aware that the unshare tool has a lot of flexibility, and with that options to create incomplete setups. If you would like to know more about idmap mounts, you can check its Linux kernel documentation. Conclusions Running pods as root is not ideal and running them as non-root is also hard with containers, as it can require a lot of changes to the applications. User namespaces are a unique feature to let you have the best of both worlds: run as non-root, without any changes to your application. This post covered: what are user namespaces, why they are important, some real world examples of CVEs mitigated by user-namespaces, and some common questions. Hopefully, this post helped you to eliminate the last doubts you had and you will now try user-namespaces (if you didn't already!). How do I get involved?

It\nisolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The\nidentifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way\nwhere host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs. Furthermore,\nthe identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged, non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on\nthe host. This brings three key benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Prevention of lateral movement</em>: As the UIDs and GIDs for different\ncontainers are mapped to different UIDs and GIDs on the host, containers have a\nharder time attacking each other, even if they escape the container boundaries.\nFor example, suppose container A runs with different UIDs and GIDs on the host\nthan container B. In that case, the operations it can do on container B's files and processes\nare limited: only read/write what a file allows to others, as it will never\nhave permission owner or group permission (the UIDs/GIDs on the host are\nguaranteed to be different for different containers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Increased host isolation</em>: As the UIDs and GIDs are mapped to unprivileged\nusers on the host, if a container escapes the container boundaries, even if it\nruns as root inside the container, it has no privileges on the host. This\ngreatly protects what host files it can read/write, which process it can send\nsignals to, etc. Furthermore, capabilities granted are only valid inside the\nuser namespace and not on the host, limiting the impact a container\nescape can have.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Enablement of new use cases</em>: User namespaces allow containers to gain\ncertain capabilities inside their own user namespace without affecting the host.\nThis unlocks new possibilities, such as running applications that require\nprivileged operations without granting full root access on the host. This is\nparticularly useful for running nested containers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"diagram-medium \">\n<img alt=\"Image showing IDs 0-65535 are reserved to the host, pods use higher IDs\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2024-04-22-userns-beta/image.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<h4>User namespace IDs allocation</h4>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If a pod running as the root user without a user namespace manages to breakout,\nit has root privileges on the node.

None of this is true when\nusing user namespaces (modulo bugs, of course \ud83d\ude42).</p>\n<h2 id=\"demos\">Demos</h2>\n<p>Rodrigo created demos to understand how some CVEs are mitigated when user\nnamespaces are used. We showed them here before (see <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/09/13/userns-alpha/\">here</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/04/22/userns-beta/\">here</a>), but take a look if you haven't:</p>\n<p>Mitigation of CVE 2024-21626 with user namespaces:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-quote-sm\">\n\n</div>\n<p>Mitigation of CVE 2022-0492 with user namespaces:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-quote-sm\">\n\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-user-namespaces-in-kubernetes\">Everything you wanted to know about user namespaces in Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>Here we try to answer some of the questions we have been asked about user\nnamespaces support in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>1. What are the requirements to use it?</strong></p>\n<p>The requirements are documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#before-you-begin\">here</a>. But we will elaborate a bit\nmore, in the following questions.</p>\n<p>Note this is a Linux-only feature.</p>\n<p><strong>2. How do I configure a pod to opt-in?</strong></p>\n<p>A complete step-by-step guide is available <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/user-namespaces/\">here</a>. But the short\nversion is you need to set the <code>hostUsers: false</code> field in the pod spec. For\nexample like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Pod<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>userns<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">hostUsers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #a2f; font-weight: bold;\">false</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>shell<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"sleep\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"infinity\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>debian<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yes, it is that simple. Applications will run just fine, without any other\nchanges needed (unless your application needs the privileges).</p>\n<p>User namespaces allows you to run as root inside the container, but not have\nprivileges in the host. However, if your application needs the privileges on the\nhost, for example an app that needs to load a kernel module, then you can't use\nuser namespaces.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What are idmap mounts and why the file-systems used need to support it?</strong></p>\n<p>Idmap mounts are a Linux kernel feature that uses a mapping of UIDs/GIDs when\naccessing a mount. When combined with user namespaces, it greatly simplifies the\nsupport for volumes, as you can forget about the host UIDs/GIDs the user\nnamespace is using.</p>\n<p>In particular, thanks to idmap mounts we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run each pod with different UIDs/GIDs on the host. This is key for the\nlateral movement prevention we mentioned earlier.</li>\n<li>Share volumes with pods that don't use user namespaces.</li>\n<li>Enable/disable user namespaces without needing to chown the pod's volumes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support for idmap mounts in the kernel is per file-system and different kernel\nreleases added support for idmap mounts on different file-systems.</p>\n<p>To find which kernel version added support for each file-system, you can check\nout the <code>mount_setattr</code> man page, or the online version of it\n<a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount_setattr.2.html#NOTES\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Most popular file-systems are supported, the notable absence that isn't\nsupported yet is NFS.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Can you clarify exactly which file-systems need to support idmap mounts?</strong></p>\n<p>The file-systems that need to support idmap mounts are all the file-systems used\nby a pod in the <code>pod.spec.volumes</code> field.</p>\n<p>This means: for PV/PVC volumes, the file-system used in the PV needs to support\nidmap mounts; for hostPath volumes, the file-system used in the hostPath\nneeds to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for secrets/configmaps/projected/downwardAPI volumes? For\nthese volumes, the kubelet creates a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system. So, you will need a\n6.3 kernel to use these volumes (note that if you use them as env variables it\nis fine).</p>\n<p>And what about emptyDir volumes? Those volumes are created by the kubelet by\ndefault in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code>. You can also use a custom directory for\nthis. But what needs to support idmap mounts is the file-system used in that\ndirectory.</p>\n<p>The kubelet creates some more files for the container, like <code>/etc/hostname</code>,\n<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, <code>/dev/termination-log</code>, <code>/etc/hosts</code>, etc. These files are\nalso created in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code> by default, so it's important for the\nfile-system used in that directory to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>Also, some container runtimes may put some of these ephemeral volumes inside a\n<code>tmpfs</code> file-system, in which case you will need support for idmap mounts in\n<code>tmpfs</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Can I use a kernel older than 6.3?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, but you will need to make sure you are not using a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system. If\nyou avoid that, you can easily use 5.19 (if all the other file-systems you use\nsupport idmap mounts in that kernel).</p>\n<p>It can be tricky to avoid using <code>tmpfs</code>, though, as we just described above.\nBesides having to avoid those volume types, you will also have to avoid mounting the\nservice account token. Every pod has it mounted by default, and it uses a\nprojected volume that, as we mentioned, uses a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system.</p>\n<p>You could even go lower than 5.19, all the way to 5.12. However, your container\nrootfs probably uses an overlayfs file-system, and support for overlayfs was\nadded in 5.19. We wouldn't recommend to use a kernel older than 5.19, as not\nbeing able to use idmap mounts for the rootfs is a big limitation. If you\nabsolutely need to, you can check <a href=\"https://kinvolk.io/blog/2023/11/tips-and-tricks-for-user-namespaces-with-kubernetes-and-containerd\">this blog post</a> Rodrigo wrote\nsome years ago, about tricks to use user namespaces when you can't support\nidmap mounts on the rootfs.</p>\n<p><strong>6. If my stack supports user namespaces, do I need to configure anything else?</strong></p>\n<p>No, if your stack supports it and you are using Kubernetes v1.33, there is\nnothing you <em>need</em> to configure. You should be able to follow the task: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/user-namespaces/\">Use a\nuser namespace with a pod</a>.</p>\n<p>However, in case you have specific requirements, you may configure various\noptions. You can find more information <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#set-up-a-node-to-support-user-namespaces\">here</a>. You can also\nenable a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#integration-with-pod-security-admission-checks\">feature gate to relax the PSS rules</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>7. The demos are nice, but are there more CVEs that this mitigates?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, quite a lot, actually! Besides the ones in the demo, the KEP has <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/b8013bfbceb16843686aebbb2ccffce81a6e772d/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces/README.md#motivation\">more CVEs\nyou can check</a>. That list is not exhaustive, there are many more.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Can you sum up why user namespaces is important?</strong></p>\n<p>Think about running a process as root, maybe even an untrusted process. Do you\nthink that is secure? What if we limit it by adding seccomp and apparmor, mask\nsome files in /proc (so it can't crash the node, etc.) and some more tweaks?</p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be better if we don't give it privileges in the first place, instead\nof trying to play whack-a-mole with all the possible ways root can escape?</p>\n<p>This is what user namespaces does, plus some other goodies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Run as an unprivileged user on the host without making changes to your application</strong>.\nGreg and Vinayak did a great talk on the pains you can face when trying to run\nunprivileged without user namespaces.

Applications will run just fine, without any other\nchanges needed (unless your application needs the privileges).</p>\n<p>User namespaces allows you to run as root inside the container, but not have\nprivileges in the host. However, if your application needs the privileges on the\nhost, for example an app that needs to load a kernel module, then you can't use\nuser namespaces.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What are idmap mounts and why the file-systems used need to support it?</strong></p>\n<p>Idmap mounts are a Linux kernel feature that uses a mapping of UIDs/GIDs when\naccessing a mount. When combined with user namespaces, it greatly simplifies the\nsupport for volumes, as you can forget about the host UIDs/GIDs the user\nnamespace is using.</p>\n<p>In particular, thanks to idmap mounts we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run each pod with different UIDs/GIDs on the host.

Can you clarify exactly which file-systems need to support idmap mounts?</strong></p>\n<p>The file-systems that need to support idmap mounts are all the file-systems used\nby a pod in the <code>pod.spec.volumes</code> field.</p>\n<p>This means: for PV/PVC volumes, the file-system used in the PV needs to support\nidmap mounts; for hostPath volumes, the file-system used in the hostPath\nneeds to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for secrets/configmaps/projected/downwardAPI volumes? For\nthese volumes, the kubelet creates a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system. So, you will need a\n6.3 kernel to use these volumes (note that if you use them as env variables it\nis fine).</p>\n<p>And what about emptyDir volumes? Those volumes are created by the kubelet by\ndefault in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code>. You can also use a custom directory for\nthis. But what needs to support idmap mounts is the file-system used in that\ndirectory.</p>\n<p>The kubelet creates some more files for the container, like <code>/etc/hostname</code>,\n<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, <code>/dev/termination-log</code>, <code>/etc/hosts</code>, etc. These files are\nalso created in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code> by default, so it's important for the\nfile-system used in that directory to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>Also, some container runtimes may put some of these ephemeral volumes inside a\n<code>tmpfs</code> file-system, in which case you will need support for idmap mounts in\n<code>tmpfs</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Can I use a kernel older than 6.3?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, but you will need to make sure you are not using a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system. If\nyou avoid that, you can easily use 5.19 (if all the other file-systems you use\nsupport idmap mounts in that kernel).</p>\n<p>It can be tricky to avoid using <code>tmpfs</code>, though, as we just described above.\nBesides having to avoid those volume types, you will also have to avoid mounting the\nservice account token. Every pod has it mounted by default, and it uses a\nprojected volume that, as we mentioned, uses a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system.</p>\n<p>You could even go lower than 5.19, all the way to 5.12. However, your container\nrootfs probably uses an overlayfs file-system, and support for overlayfs was\nadded in 5.19. We wouldn't recommend to use a kernel older than 5.19, as not\nbeing able to use idmap mounts for the rootfs is a big limitation. If you\nabsolutely need to, you can check <a href=\"https://kinvolk.io/blog/2023/11/tips-and-tricks-for-user-namespaces-with-kubernetes-and-containerd\">this blog post</a> Rodrigo wrote\nsome years ago, about tricks to use user namespaces when you can't support\nidmap mounts on the rootfs.</p>\n<p><strong>6. If my stack supports user namespaces, do I need to configure anything else?</strong></p>\n<p>No, if your stack supports it and you are using Kubernetes v1.33, there is\nnothing you <em>need</em> to configure. You should be able to follow the task: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/user-namespaces/\">Use a\nuser namespace with a pod</a>.</p>\n<p>However, in case you have specific requirements, you may configure various\noptions. You can find more information <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#set-up-a-node-to-support-user-namespaces\">here</a>. You can also\nenable a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#integration-with-pod-security-admission-checks\">feature gate to relax the PSS rules</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>7. The demos are nice, but are there more CVEs that this mitigates?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, quite a lot, actually! Besides the ones in the demo, the KEP has <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/b8013bfbceb16843686aebbb2ccffce81a6e772d/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces/README.md#motivation\">more CVEs\nyou can check</a>. That list is not exhaustive, there are many more.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Can you sum up why user namespaces is important?</strong></p>\n<p>Think about running a process as root, maybe even an untrusted process. Do you\nthink that is secure? What if we limit it by adding seccomp and apparmor, mask\nsome files in /proc (so it can't crash the node, etc.) and some more tweaks?</p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be better if we don't give it privileges in the first place, instead\nof trying to play whack-a-mole with all the possible ways root can escape?</p>\n<p>This is what user namespaces does, plus some other goodies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Run as an unprivileged user on the host without making changes to your application</strong>.\nGreg and Vinayak did a great talk on the pains you can face when trying to run\nunprivileged without user namespaces. The pains part <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uouH9fsWVIE?feature=shared&amp;t=351\">starts in this minute</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>All pods run with different UIDs/GIDs, we significantly improve the lateral\nmovement</strong>. This is guaranteed with user namespaces (the kubelet chooses it for\nyou). In the same talk, Greg and Vinayak show that to achieve the same without\nuser namespaces, they went through a quite complex custom solution. This part\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uouH9fsWVIE?feature=shared&amp;t=793\">starts in this minute</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The capabilities granted are only granted inside the user namespace</strong>. That\nmeans that if a pod breaks out of the container, they are not valid on the\nhost. We can't provide that without user namespaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It enables new use-cases in a <em>secure</em> way</strong>. You can run docker in docker,\nunprivileged container builds, Kubernetes inside Kubernetes, etc all <strong>in a secure\nway</strong>. Most of the previous solutions to do this required privileged containers or\nputting the node at a high risk of compromise.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>9. Is there container runtime documentation for user namespaces?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/b22a302a75d9a7d7955780e54cc5b32de6c8525d/docs/user-namespaces\">containerd\ndocumentation</a>.\nThis explains different limitations of containerd 1.7 and how to use\nuser namespaces in containerd without Kubernetes pods (using <code>ctr</code>). Note that\nif you use containerd, you need containerd 2.0 or higher to use user namespaces\nwith Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>CRI-O doesn't have special documentation for user namespaces, it works out of\nthe box.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What about the other container runtimes?</strong></p>\n<p>No other container runtime that we are aware of supports user namespaces with\nKubernetes. That sadly includes <a href=\"https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/issues/74\">cri-dockerd</a> too.</p>\n<p><strong>11. I'd like to learn more about it, what would you recommend?</strong></p>\n<p>Rodrigo did an introduction to user namespaces at KubeCon 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sched.co/182K0\">Run As \u201cRoot\u201d, Not Root: User Namespaces In K8s- Marga Manterola, Isovalent &amp; Rodrigo Campos Catelin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, this aforementioned presentation at KubeCon 2023 can be\nuseful as a motivation for user namespaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sched.co/1HyX4\">Least Privilege Containers: Keeping a Bad Day from Getting Worse - Greg Castle &amp; Vinayak Goyal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bear in mind the presentation are some years old, some things have changed since\nthen. Use the Kubernetes documentation as the source of truth.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about the low-level details of user namespaces,\nyou can check <code>man 7 user_namespaces</code> and <code>man 1 unshare</code>. You can easily create\nnamespaces and experiment with how they behave. Be aware that the <code>unshare</code> tool\nhas a lot of flexibility, and with that options to create incomplete setups.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about idmap mounts, you can check <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/idmappings.html\">its Linux\nkernel documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Running pods as root is not ideal and running them as non-root is also hard\nwith containers, as it can require a lot of changes to the applications.\nUser namespaces are a unique feature to let you have the best of both worlds: run\nas non-root, without any changes to your application.</p>\n<p>This post covered: what are user namespaces, why they are important, some real\nworld examples of CVEs mitigated by user-namespaces, and some common questions.\nHopefully, this post helped you to eliminate the last doubts you had and you\nwill now try user-namespaces (if you didn't already!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h2>\n<p>You can reach SIG Node by several means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-node\">#sig-node</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-node\">Mailing list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/sig%2Fnode\">Open Community Issues/PRs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also contact us directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub: @rata @giuseppe @saschagrunert</li>\n<li>Slack: @rata @giuseppe @sascha</li>\n</ul>"

To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature\nflag anymore!</p>\n<p>In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But,\nbefore we dive into that, let's recap what user namespaces are and why they are\nimportant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-user-namespace\">What is a user namespace?</h2>\n<p>Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/\">Kubernetes\nnamespaces</a>.\nThe former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature.</p>\n<p>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For\nexample, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the\nnetwork identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.</p>\n<p>One Linux namespace that was left behind is the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html\">user\nnamespace</a>. It\nisolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The\nidentifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way\nwhere host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs. Furthermore,\nthe identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged, non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on\nthe host. This brings three key benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Prevention of lateral movement</em>: As the UIDs and GIDs for different\ncontainers are mapped to different UIDs and GIDs on the host, containers have a\nharder time attacking each other, even if they escape the container boundaries.\nFor example, suppose container A runs with different UIDs and GIDs on the host\nthan container B. In that case, the operations it can do on container B's files and processes\nare limited: only read/write what a file allows to others, as it will never\nhave permission owner or group permission (the UIDs/GIDs on the host are\nguaranteed to be different for different containers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Increased host isolation</em>: As the UIDs and GIDs are mapped to unprivileged\nusers on the host, if a container escapes the container boundaries, even if it\nruns as root inside the container, it has no privileges on the host. This\ngreatly protects what host files it can read/write, which process it can send\nsignals to, etc. Furthermore, capabilities granted are only valid inside the\nuser namespace and not on the host, limiting the impact a container\nescape can have.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Enablement of new use cases</em>: User namespaces allow containers to gain\ncertain capabilities inside their own user namespace without affecting the host.\nThis unlocks new possibilities, such as running applications that require\nprivileged operations without granting full root access on the host. This is\nparticularly useful for running nested containers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"diagram-medium \">\n<img alt=\"Image showing IDs 0-65535 are reserved to the host, pods use higher IDs\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2024-04-22-userns-beta/image.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<h4>User namespace IDs allocation</h4>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If a pod running as the root user without a user namespace manages to breakout,\nit has root privileges on the node. If some capabilities were granted to the\ncontainer, the capabilities are valid on the host too. None of this is true when\nusing user namespaces (modulo bugs, of course \ud83d\ude42).</p>\n<h2 id=\"demos\">Demos</h2>\n<p>Rodrigo created demos to understand how some CVEs are mitigated when user\nnamespaces are used. We showed them here before (see <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/09/13/userns-alpha/\">here</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/04/22/userns-beta/\">here</a>), but take a look if you haven't:</p>\n<p>Mitigation of CVE 2024-21626 with user namespaces:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-quote-sm\">\n\n</div>\n<p>Mitigation of CVE 2022-0492 with user namespaces:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-quote-sm\">\n\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-user-namespaces-in-kubernetes\">Everything you wanted to know about user namespaces in Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>Here we try to answer some of the questions we have been asked about user\nnamespaces support in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>1. What are the requirements to use it?</strong></p>\n<p>The requirements are documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/#before-you-begin\">here</a>. But we will elaborate a bit\nmore, in the following questions.</p>\n<p>Note this is a Linux-only feature.</p>\n<p><strong>2. How do I configure a pod to opt-in?</strong></p>\n<p>A complete step-by-step guide is available <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/user-namespaces/\">here</a>. But the short\nversion is you need to set the <code>hostUsers: false</code> field in the pod spec. For\nexample like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Pod<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>userns<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">hostUsers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #a2f; font-weight: bold;\">false</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>shell<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"sleep\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"infinity\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>debian<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yes, it is that simple. Applications will run just fine, without any other\nchanges needed (unless your application needs the privileges).</p>\n<p>User namespaces allows you to run as root inside the container, but not have\nprivileges in the host. However, if your application needs the privileges on the\nhost, for example an app that needs to load a kernel module, then you can't use\nuser namespaces.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What are idmap mounts and why the file-systems used need to support it?</strong></p>\n<p>Idmap mounts are a Linux kernel feature that uses a mapping of UIDs/GIDs when\naccessing a mount. When combined with user namespaces, it greatly simplifies the\nsupport for volumes, as you can forget about the host UIDs/GIDs the user\nnamespace is using.</p>\n<p>In particular, thanks to idmap mounts we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run each pod with different UIDs/GIDs on the host. This is key for the\nlateral movement prevention we mentioned earlier.</li>\n<li>Share volumes with pods that don't use user namespaces.</li>\n<li>Enable/disable user namespaces without needing to chown the pod's volumes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support for idmap mounts in the kernel is per file-system and different kernel\nreleases added support for idmap mounts on different file-systems.</p>\n<p>To find which kernel version added support for each file-system, you can check\nout the <code>mount_setattr</code> man page, or the online version of it\n<a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount_setattr.2.html#NOTES\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Most popular file-systems are supported, the notable absence that isn't\nsupported yet is NFS.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Can you clarify exactly which file-systems need to support idmap mounts?</strong></p>\n<p>The file-systems that need to support idmap mounts are all the file-systems used\nby a pod in the <code>pod.spec.volumes</code> field.</p>\n<p>This means: for PV/PVC volumes, the file-system used in the PV needs to support\nidmap mounts; for hostPath volumes, the file-system used in the hostPath\nneeds to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for secrets/configmaps/projected/downwardAPI volumes? For\nthese volumes, the kubelet creates a <code>tmpfs</code> file-system. So, you will need a\n6.3 kernel to use these volumes (note that if you use them as env variables it\nis fine).</p>\n<p>And what about emptyDir volumes? Those volumes are created by the kubelet by\ndefault in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code>. You can also use a custom directory for\nthis. But what needs to support idmap mounts is the file-system used in that\ndirectory.</p>\n<p>The kubelet creates some more files for the container, like <code>/etc/hostname</code>,\n<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, <code>/dev/termination-log</code>, <code>/etc/hosts</code>, etc. These files are\nalso created in <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pods/</code> by default, so it's important for the\nfile-system used in that directory to support idmap mounts.</p>\n<p>Also, some container runtimes may put some of these ephemeral volumes inside a\n<code>tmpfs</code> file-system, in which case you will need support for idmap mounts in\n<code>tmpfs</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

      "summary": "Kubernetes has deprecated its Endpoints API in version 1.",
      "summary_original": "Since the addition of EndpointSlices (KEP-752) as alpha in v1.15 and later GA in v1.21, the Endpoints API in Kubernetes has been gathering dust. New Service features like dual-stack networking and traffic distribution are only supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies, Gateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be ported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point, the Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user workloads and scripts that still make use of it. As of Kubernetes 1.33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated, and the API server will return warnings to users who read or write Endpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices. Eventually, the plan (as documented in KEP-4974) is to change the Kubernetes Conformance criteria to no longer require that clusters run the Endpoints controller (which generates Endpoints objects based on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in most modern-day clusters. Thus, while the Kubernetes deprecation policy means that the Endpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users who still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should start migrating them to EndpointSlices. Notes on migrating from Endpoints to EndpointSlices Consuming EndpointSlices rather than Endpoints For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the EndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a selector has exactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a Service may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it: $ kubectl get endpoints myservice Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery.k8s.io/v1 EndpointSlice NAME ENDPOINTS AGE myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name=myservice NAME ADDRESSTYPE PORTS ENDPOINTS AGE myservice-7vzhx IPv4 443 10.180.3.17 21s myservice-jcv8s IPv6 443 2001:db8:0123::5 21s In this case, because the service is dual stack, it has 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for IPv4 addresses and 1 for IPv6 addresses. (The Endpoints API does not support dual stack, so the Endpoints object shows only the addresses in the cluster's primary address family.) Although any Service with multiple endpoints can have multiple EndpointSlices, there are three main cases where you will see this: An EndpointSlice can only represent endpoints of a single IP family, so dual-stack Services will have separate EndpointSlices for IPv4 and IPv6. All of the endpoints in an EndpointSlice must target the same ports. So, for example, if you have a set of endpoint Pods listening on port 80, and roll out an update to make them listen on port 8080 instead, then while the rollout is in progress, the Service will need 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for the endpoints listening on port 80, and 1 for the endpoints listening on port 8080. When a Service has more than 100 endpoints, the EndpointSlice controller will split the endpoints into multiple EndpointSlices rather than aggregating them into a single excessively-large object like the Endpoints controller does. Because there is not a predictable 1-to-1 mapping between Services and EndpointSlices, there is no way to know what the actual name of the EndpointSlice resource(s) for a Service will be ahead of time; thus, instead of fetching the EndpointSlice(s) by name, you instead ask for all EndpointSlices with a \"kubernetes.io/service-name\" label pointing to the Service: $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name=myservice A similar change is needed in Go code. With Endpoints, you would do something like: // Get the Endpoints named `name` in `namespace`. endpoint, err := client.CoreV1().Endpoints(namespace).Get(ctx, name, metav1.GetOptions{}) if err != nil { if apierrors.IsNotFound(err) { // No Endpoints exists for the Service (yet?) ... } // handle other errors ... } // process `endpoint` ... With EndpointSlices, this becomes: // Get all EndpointSlices for Service `name` in `namespace`. slices, err := client.DiscoveryV1().EndpointSlices(namespace).List(ctx, metav1.ListOptions{LabelSelector: discoveryv1.LabelServiceName + \"=\" + name}) if err != nil { // handle errors ... } else if len(slices.Items) == 0 { // No EndpointSlices exist for the Service (yet?) ... } // process `slices.Items` ... Generating EndpointSlices rather than Endpoints For people (or controllers) generating Endpoints, migrating to EndpointSlices is slightly easier, because in most cases you won't have to worry about multiple slices. You just need to update your YAML or Go code to use the new type (which organizes the information in a slightly different way than Endpoints did). For example, this Endpoints object: apiVersion: v1 kind: Endpoints metadata: name: myservice subsets: - addresses: - ip: 10.180.3.17 nodeName: node-4 - ip: 10.180.5.22 nodeName: node-9 - ip: 10.180.18.2 nodeName: node-7 notReadyAddresses: - ip: 10.180.6.6 nodeName: node-8 ports: - name: https protocol: TCP port: 443 would become something like: apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1 kind: EndpointSlice metadata: name: myservice labels: kubernetes.io/service-name: myservice addressType: IPv4 endpoints: - addresses: - 10.180.3.17 nodeName: node-4 - addresses: - 10.180.5.22 nodeName: node-9 - addresses: - 10.180.18.12 nodeName: node-7 - addresses: - 10.180.6.6 nodeName: node-8 conditions: ready: false ports: - name: https protocol: TCP port: 443 Some points to note: This example uses an explicit name, but you could also use generateName and let the API server append a unique suffix. The name itself does not matter: what matters is the \"kubernetes.io/service-name\" label pointing back to the Service. You have to explicitly indicate addressType: IPv4 (or IPv6). An EndpointSlice is similar to a single element of the \"subsets\" array in Endpoints. An Endpoints object with multiple subsets will normally need to be expressed as multiple EndpointSlices, each with different \"ports\". The endpoints and addresses fields are both arrays, but by convention, each addresses array only contains a single element. If your Service has multiple endpoints, then you need to have multiple elements in the endpoints array, each with a single element in its addresses array. The Endpoints API lists \"ready\" and \"not-ready\" endpoints separately, while the EndpointSlice API allows each endpoint to have conditions (such as \"ready: false\") associated with it. And of course, once you have ported to EndpointSlice, you can make use of EndpointSlice-specific features, such as topology hints and terminating endpoints. Consult the EndpointSlice API documentation for more information.",

The name\nitself does not matter: what matters is the\n<code>&quot;kubernetes.io/service-name&quot;</code> label pointing back to the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have to explicitly indicate <code>addressType: IPv4</code> (or <code>IPv6</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An EndpointSlice is similar to a single element of the <code>&quot;subsets&quot;</code>\narray in Endpoints. An Endpoints object with multiple subsets will\nnormally need to be expressed as multiple EndpointSlices, each with\ndifferent <code>&quot;ports&quot;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>endpoints</code> and <code>addresses</code> fields are both arrays, but by\nconvention, each <code>addresses</code> array only contains a single element. If\nyour Service has multiple endpoints, then you need to have multiple\nelements in the <code>endpoints</code> array, each with a single element in its\n<code>addresses</code> array.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Endpoints API lists &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;not-ready&quot; endpoints\nseparately, while the EndpointSlice API allows each endpoint to have\nconditions (such as &quot;<code>ready: false</code>&quot;) associated with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And of course, once you have ported to EndpointSlice, you can make use\nof EndpointSlice-specific features, such as topology hints and\nterminating endpoints.

          "summary_text": "<p>Since the addition of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/02/scaling-kubernetes-networking-with-endpointslices/\">EndpointSlices</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/0752-endpointslices/README.md\">KEP-752</a>) as alpha in v1.15\nand later GA in v1.21, the\nEndpoints API in Kubernetes has been gathering dust. New Service\nfeatures like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/\">dual-stack networking</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#traffic-distribution\">traffic distribution</a> are\nonly supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies,\nGateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be\nported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point,\nthe Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user\nworkloads and scripts that still make use of it.</p>\n<p>As of Kubernetes 1.33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated,\nand the API server will return warnings to users who read or write\nEndpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the plan (as documented in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4974-deprecate-endpoints/README.md\">KEP-4974</a>) is to change the\n<a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/\">Kubernetes Conformance</a> criteria to no longer require that clusters\nrun the <em>Endpoints controller</em> (which generates Endpoints objects\nbased on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in\nmost modern-day clusters.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">Kubernetes deprecation policy</a> means that the\nEndpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users\nwho still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should\nstart migrating them to EndpointSlices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes-on-migrating-from-endpoints-to-endpointslices\">Notes on migrating from Endpoints to EndpointSlices</h2>\n<h3 id=\"consuming-endpointslices-rather-than-endpoints\">Consuming EndpointSlices rather than Endpoints</h3>\n<p>For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the\nEndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a <code>selector</code> has\nexactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a\nService may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpoints myservice\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery.k8s.io/v1 EndpointSlice\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME ENDPOINTS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span>\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>myservice\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME ADDRESSTYPE PORTS ENDPOINTS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice-7vzhx IPv4 443 10.180.3.17 21s\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice-jcv8s IPv6 443 2001:db8:0123::5 21s\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, because the service is dual stack, it has 2\nEndpointSlices: 1 for IPv4 addresses and 1 for IPv6 addresses. (The\nEndpoints API does not support dual stack, so the Endpoints object\nshows only the addresses in the cluster's primary address family.)\nAlthough any Service with multiple endpoints <em>can</em> have multiple\nEndpointSlices, there are three main cases where you will see this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An EndpointSlice can only represent endpoints of a single IP\nfamily, so dual-stack Services will have separate EndpointSlices\nfor IPv4 and IPv6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the endpoints in an EndpointSlice must target the same\nports. So, for example, if you have a set of endpoint Pods\nlistening on port 80, and roll out an update to make them listen\non port 8080 instead, then while the rollout is in progress, the\nService will need 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for the endpoints listening\non port 80, and 1 for the endpoints listening on port 8080.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a Service has more than 100 endpoints, the EndpointSlice\ncontroller will split the endpoints into multiple EndpointSlices\nrather than aggregating them into a single excessively-large\nobject like the Endpoints controller does.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because there is not a predictable 1-to-1 mapping between Services and\nEndpointSlices, there is no way to know what the actual name of the\nEndpointSlice resource(s) for a Service will be ahead of time; thus,\ninstead of fetching the EndpointSlice(s) by name, you instead ask for\nall EndpointSlices with a &quot;<code>kubernetes.io/service-name</code>&quot;\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/\">label</a> pointing\nto the Service:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>myservice\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A similar change is needed in Go code.

The name\nitself does not matter: what matters is the\n<code>&quot;kubernetes.io/service-name&quot;</code> label pointing back to the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have to explicitly indicate <code>addressType: IPv4</code> (or <code>IPv6</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An EndpointSlice is similar to a single element of the <code>&quot;subsets&quot;</code>\narray in Endpoints. An Endpoints object with multiple subsets will\nnormally need to be expressed as multiple EndpointSlices, each with\ndifferent <code>&quot;ports&quot;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>endpoints</code> and <code>addresses</code> fields are both arrays, but by\nconvention, each <code>addresses</code> array only contains a single element. If\nyour Service has multiple endpoints, then you need to have multiple\nelements in the <code>endpoints</code> array, each with a single element in its\n<code>addresses</code> array.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Endpoints API lists &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;not-ready&quot; endpoints\nseparately, while the EndpointSlice API allows each endpoint to have\nconditions (such as &quot;<code>ready: false</code>&quot;) associated with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And of course, once you have ported to EndpointSlice, you can make use\nof EndpointSlice-specific features, such as topology hints and\nterminating endpoints.

New Service\nfeatures like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/\">dual-stack networking</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#traffic-distribution\">traffic distribution</a> are\nonly supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies,\nGateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be\nported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point,\nthe Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user\nworkloads and scripts that still make use of it.</p>\n<p>As of Kubernetes 1.33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated,\nand the API server will return warnings to users who read or write\nEndpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the plan (as documented in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4974-deprecate-endpoints/README.md\">KEP-4974</a>) is to change the\n<a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/\">Kubernetes Conformance</a> criteria to no longer require that clusters\nrun the <em>Endpoints controller</em> (which generates Endpoints objects\nbased on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in\nmost modern-day clusters.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">Kubernetes deprecation policy</a> means that the\nEndpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users\nwho still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should\nstart migrating them to EndpointSlices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes-on-migrating-from-endpoints-to-endpointslices\">Notes on migrating from Endpoints to EndpointSlices</h2>\n<h3 id=\"consuming-endpointslices-rather-than-endpoints\">Consuming EndpointSlices rather than Endpoints</h3>\n<p>For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the\nEndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a <code>selector</code> has\nexactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a\nService may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpoints myservice\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery.k8s.io/v1 EndpointSlice\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME ENDPOINTS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span>\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>myservice\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME ADDRESSTYPE PORTS ENDPOINTS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice-7vzhx IPv4 443 10.180.3.17 21s\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">myservice-jcv8s IPv6 443 2001:db8:0123::5 21s\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, because the service is dual stack, it has 2\nEndpointSlices: 1 for IPv4 addresses and 1 for IPv6 addresses. (The\nEndpoints API does not support dual stack, so the Endpoints object\nshows only the addresses in the cluster's primary address family.)\nAlthough any Service with multiple endpoints <em>can</em> have multiple\nEndpointSlices, there are three main cases where you will see this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An EndpointSlice can only represent endpoints of a single IP\nfamily, so dual-stack Services will have separate EndpointSlices\nfor IPv4 and IPv6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the endpoints in an EndpointSlice must target the same\nports. So, for example, if you have a set of endpoint Pods\nlistening on port 80, and roll out an update to make them listen\non port 8080 instead, then while the rollout is in progress, the\nService will need 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for the endpoints listening\non port 80, and 1 for the endpoints listening on port 8080.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a Service has more than 100 endpoints, the EndpointSlice\ncontroller will split the endpoints into multiple EndpointSlices\nrather than aggregating them into a single excessively-large\nobject like the Endpoints controller does.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because there is not a predictable 1-to-1 mapping between Services and\nEndpointSlices, there is no way to know what the actual name of the\nEndpointSlice resource(s) for a Service will be ahead of time; thus,\ninstead of fetching the EndpointSlice(s) by name, you instead ask for\nall EndpointSlices with a &quot;<code>kubernetes.io/service-name</code>&quot;\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/\">label</a> pointing\nto the Service:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.io/service-name<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>myservice\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A similar change is needed in Go code.

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Aakanksha Bhende, Udi Hofesh, Ryota Sawada, Sneha Yadav Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.33 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are entering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn. There are also several notable deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes. Release theme and logo The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is Octarine: The Color of Magic1, inspired by Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld series. This release highlights the open source magic2 that Kubernetes enables across the ecosystem. If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched atop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of Ankh-Morpork with 64 stars3 in the background. As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the curiosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33 release is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d Even if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the release cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical. Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of contributors4 from around the world work together to create something truly extraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the project, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the other, creating something greater than we could achieve alone. 1. Octarine is the mythical eighth color, visible only to those attuned to the arcane\u2014wizards, witches, and, of course, cats. And occasionally, someone who\u2019s stared at IPtable rules for too long. 2. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u2026? 3. It\u2019s not a coincidence 64 KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals) are also included in v1.33. 4. See the Project Velocity section for v1.33 \ud83d\ude80 Spotlight on key updates Kubernetes v1.33 is packed with new features and improvements. Here are a few select updates the Release Team would like to highlight! Stable: Sidecar containers The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities in areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable in v1.33. Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with restartPolicy: Always, ensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's lifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit. Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational state, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to prevent premature termination under memory pressure. To learn more, read Sidecar Containers. This work was done as part of KEP-753: Sidecar Containers led by SIG Node. Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template for the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of the number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica count, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's spec were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement. But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them? The KEP-1287 is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was released as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities for vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once the initial setup is complete. This work was done as part of KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources led by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling. Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with .kuberc for user preferences In v1.33, kubectl introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file .kuberc for user preferences. This file can contain kubectl aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use server-side apply), while leaving cluster credentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user preferences for kubectl interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used. To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of KUBECTL_KUBERC=true and create a .kuberc configuration file. By default, kubectl looks for this file in ~/.kube/kuberc. You can also specify an alternative location using the --kuberc flag, for example: kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc. This work was done as part of KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs led by SIG CLI. Features graduating to Stable This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release. Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs \u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed Jobs. Traditionally, the backoffLimit parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries before considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed Job to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for individual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate the entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently. This work was done as part of KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs led by SIG Apps. Job success policy Using .spec.successPolicy, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (succeededIndexes), how many pods must succeed (succeededCount), or a combination of both. This feature benefits various workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker patterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome. This work was done as part of KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy led by SIG Apps. Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e. JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI) and node information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it supports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes, thereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now generally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within Kubernetes clusters. This work was done as part of KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements led by SIG Auth. Subresource support in kubectl The --subresource argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as get, patch, edit, apply and replace, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all resources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the kubectl reference. This work was done as part of KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl led by SIG CLI. Multiple Service CIDRs This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the whole cluster, every Service of type: ClusterIP must have a unique IP address assigned to it. Trying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an error. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: ServiceCIDR and IPAddress. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically increase the number of IP addresses available for type: ClusterIP Services (by creating new ServiceCIDR objects). This work was done as part of KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs led by SIG Network. nftables backend for kube-proxy The nftables backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly improves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For compatibility reasons, iptables remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the migration guide if you want to try it out. This work was done as part of KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend led by SIG Network. Topology aware routing with trafficDistribution: PreferClose This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us to optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would enable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone, thereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this, trafficDistribution field is added to the Service specification, with the PreferClose option directing traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration enhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication. This work was done as part of KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services and KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing led by SIG Network. Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not align with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally available, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce allocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems, thereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways. This work was done as part of KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload led by SIG Node. Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using matchLabelKeys and mismatchLabelKeys The matchLabelKeys and mismatchLabelKeys fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling users to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not (AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing labelSelector mechanism. The affinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation of services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations. This work was done as part of KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity led by SIG Scheduling. Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew This enhanced PodTopologySpread by introducing two fields: nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints should be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default, nodeAffinityPolicy is set to Honor, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or selector are included in the distribution calculation. The nodeTaintsPolicy defaults to Ignore, indicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer control over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and taint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to unsatisfied constraints. This work was done as part of KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew led by SIG Scheduling. Volume populators After being released as beta in v1.24, volume populators have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly stable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources, and not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on the dataSourceRef field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than the existing dataSource field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources. A special controller, volume-data-source-validator, validates these data source references, alongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The VolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they support. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators. This work was done as part of KEP-1495: Generic data populators led by SIG Storage. Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not consistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted before its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the \"Delete\" reclaim policy may not be executed, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets finalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion sequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains consistency in PV lifecycle management. This work was done as part of KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy led by SIG Storage. New features in Beta This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release. Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers to bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer and also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell. Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy. Structured parameter support While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version simplifies the resource.k8s.io API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster edit role can now use DRA. The kubelet now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use a rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of ResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades. Additionally, a 30-second grace period has been introduced before the kubelet cleans up after unregistering a driver, providing better support for drivers that do not use rolling updates. This work was done as part of KEP-4381: DRA: structured parameters by WG Device Management, a cross-functional team including SIG Node, SIG Scheduling, and SIG Autoscaling. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) for network interfaces The standardized reporting of network interface data via DRA, introduced in v1.32, has graduated to beta in v1.33. This enables more native Kubernetes network integrations, simplifying the development and management of networking devices. This was covered previously in the v1.32 release announcement blog. This work was done as part of KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data led by SIG Network, SIG Node, and WG Device Management. Handle unscheduled pods early when scheduler does not have any pod on activeQ This feature improves queue scheduling behavior. Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by popping pods from the backoffQ, which are not backed off due to errors, when the activeQ is empty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the activeQ was empty; this enhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that. This work was done as part of KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty led by SIG Scheduling. Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones. Asynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this enhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays. This improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a more efficient and resilient scheduling process. This work was done as part of KEP-4832: Asynchronous preemption in the scheduler led by SIG Scheduling. ClusterTrustBundles ClusterTrustBundle, a cluster-scoped resource designed for holding X.509 trust anchors (root certificates), has graduated to beta in v1.33. This API makes it easier for in-cluster certificate signers to publish and communicate X.509 trust anchors to cluster workloads. This work was done as part of KEP-3257: ClusterTrustBundles (previously Trust Anchor Sets) led by SIG Auth. Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control Introduced in v1.31, this feature graduates to beta in v1.33 and is now enabled by default. Provided that your cluster has the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature gate enabled, the supplementalGroupsPolicy field within a Pod's securityContext supports two policies: the default Merge policy maintains backward compatibility by combining specified groups with those from the container image's /etc/group file, whereas the new Strict policy applies only to explicitly defined groups. This enhancement helps to address security concerns where implicit group memberships from container images could lead to unintended file access permissions and bypass policy controls. This work was done as part of KEP-3619: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control led by SIG Node. Support for mounting images as volumes Support for using Open Container Initiative (OCI) images as volumes in Pods, introduced in v1.31, has graduated to beta. This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod while reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the volume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the main image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation. This work was done as part of KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image led by SIG Node and SIG Storage. Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is KEP-127, Pod security improvement by using Linux User namespaces for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and has moved to on-by-default beta as part of v1.33. This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify pod.spec.hostUsers to opt in. As highlighted in the v1.30 sneak peek blog, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities. This work was done as part of KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods led by SIG Node. Pod procMount option The procMount option, introduced as alpha in v1.12, and off-by-default beta in v1.31, has moved to an on-by-default beta in v1.33. This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to fine-tune access to the /proc filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod securityContext that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain /proc paths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged containers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the CRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict /proc mount settings. However, to successfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those defaults, and this feature provides exactly that. This work was done as part of KEP-4265: add ProcMount option led by SIG Node. CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node. It optimizes CPU resource allocation by balancing workloads across multiple NUMA nodes, thereby improving performance and resource utilization in multi-NUMA systems. This work was done as part of KEP-2902: Add CPUManager policy option to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes instead of packing them led by SIG Node. Zero-second sleeps for container PreStop hooks Kubernetes 1.29 introduced a Sleep action for the preStop lifecycle hook in Pods, allowing containers to pause for a specified duration before termination. This provides a straightforward method to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup operations. The Sleep action in a preStop hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature. This allows defining a no-op preStop hook, which is useful when a preStop hook is required but no delay is desired. This work was done as part of KEP-3960: Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook and KEP-4818: Allow zero value for Sleep Action of PreStop Hook led by SIG Node. Internal tooling for declarative validation of Kubernetes-native types Behind the scenes, the internals of Kubernetes are starting to use a new mechanism for validating objects and changes to objects. Kubernetes v1.33 introduces validation-gen, an internal tool that Kubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve the robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation constraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the codebase. This work was done as part of KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen led by SIG API Machinery. New features in Alpha This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release. Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling reactions to small metric variations. This work was done as part of KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers led by SIG Autoscaling. Configurable container restart delay Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to fine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled. This work was done as part of KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff led by SIG Node. Custom container stop signals Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example, via the StopSignal configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination behavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha) ContainerStopSignals feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals directly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's lifecycle.stopSignal field and requires the Pod's spec.os.name field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to the image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for Linux). This work was done as part of KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals led by SIG Node. DRA enhancements galore! Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for today\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and containers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network adapters. The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33: Similar to Node taints, by enabling the DRADeviceTaints feature gate, devices support taints and tolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage. Scheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods using a tainted device can be evicted. By enabling the feature gate DRAPrioritizedList, DeviceRequests get a new field named firstAvailable. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may be satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is not available. With feature gate DRAAdminAccess enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with resource.k8s.io/admin-access: \"true\" can use the adminAccess field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the adminAccess feature. While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition devices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the DRAPartitionableDevices feature gate in v1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The Kubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the allocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to dynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are automatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization. These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate. This work was done as part of KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations, KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests, KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates, and KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices, led by SIG Node, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth. Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for IfNotPresent and Never This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for each new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node. This work was done as part of KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images led by SIG Auth. Node topology labels are available via downward API This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API. Prior to Kubernetes v1.33, a workaround involved using an init container to query the Kubernetes API for the underlying node; this alpha feature simplifies how workloads can access Node topology information. This work was done as part of KEP-4742: Expose Node labels via downward API led by SIG Node. Better pod status with generation and observed generation Prior to this change, the metadata.generation field was unused in pods. Along with extending to support metadata.generation, this feature will introduce status.observedGeneration to provide clearer pod status. This work was done as part of KEP-5067: Pod Generation led by SIG Node. Support for split level 3 cache architecture with kubelet\u2019s CPU Manager The previous kubelet\u2019s CPU Manager was unaware of split L3 cache architecture (also known as Last Level Cache, or LLC), and can potentially distribute CPU assignments without considering the split L3 cache, causing a noisy neighbor problem. This alpha feature improves the CPU Manager to better assign CPU cores for better performance. This work was done as part of KEP-5109: Split L3 Cache Topology Awareness in CPU Manager led by SIG Node. PSI (Pressure Stall Information) metrics for scheduling improvements This feature adds support on Linux nodes for providing PSI stats and metrics using cgroupv2. It can detect resource shortages and provide nodes with more granular control for pod scheduling. This work was done as part of KEP-4205: Support PSI based on cgroupv2 led by SIG Node. Secret-less image pulls with kubelet The kubelet's on-disk credential provider now supports optional Kubernetes ServiceAccount (SA) token fetching. This simplifies authentication with image registries by allowing cloud providers to better integrate with OIDC compatible identity solutions. This work was done as part of KEP-4412: Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers led by SIG Auth. Graduations, deprecations, and removals in v1.33 Graduations to stable This lists all the features that have graduated to stable (also known as general availability). For a full list of updates including new features and graduations from alpha to beta, see the release notes. This release includes a total of 18 enhancements promoted to stable: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity Bound service account token improvements Generic data populators Multiple Service CIDRs Topology Aware Routing Portworx file in-tree to CSI driver migration Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy nftables kube-proxy backend Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field Add subresource support to kubectl Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs Job success/completion policy Sidecar Containers CRD Validation Ratcheting node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload Traffic Distribution for Services Recursive Read-only (RRO) mounts Deprecations and removals As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones to improve the project's overall health. See the Kubernetes deprecation and removal policy for more details on this process. Many of these deprecations and removals were announced in the Deprecations and Removals blog post. Deprecation of the stable Endpoints API The EndpointSlices API has been stable since v1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation. This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans. You can find more in KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints. Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31 release announcement, the .status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field for Nodes was removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, this field has been removed entirely in v1.33. You can find more in KEP-4004: Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field. Removal of in-tree gitRepo volume driver The gitRepo volume type has been deprecated since v1.11, nearly 7 years ago. Since its deprecation, there have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain remote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed. There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. gitVolumes in the Kubernetes API is not removed, and thus pods with gitRepo volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets with the feature-gate GitRepoVolumeDriver set to false will not run them and return an appropriate error to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them enough time to fix workloads. The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release. You can find more in KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver. Removal of host network support for Windows pods Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP. Support was fully removed in v1.33. Please note that this does not affect HostProcess containers, which provides host network as well as host level access. The KEP withdrawn in v1.33 was about providing the host network only, which was never stable due to technical limitations with Windows networking logic. You can find more in KEP-3503: Host network support for Windows pods. Release notes Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.33 release in our release notes. Availability Kubernetes v1.33 is available for download on GitHub or on the Kubernetes download page. To get started with Kubernetes, check out these interactive tutorials or run local Kubernetes clusters using minikube. You can also easily install v1.33 using kubeadm. Release Team Kubernetes is only possible with the support, commitment, and hard work of its community. Release Team is made up of dedicated community volunteers who work together to build the many pieces that make up the Kubernetes releases you rely on. This requires the specialized skills of people from all corners of our community, from the code itself to its documentation and project management. We would like to thank the entire Release Team for the hours spent hard at work to deliver the Kubernetes v1.33 release to our community. The Release Team's membership ranges from first-time shadows to returning team leads with experience forged over several release cycles. There was a new team structure adopted in this release cycle, which was to combine Release Notes and Docs subteams into a unified subteam of Docs. Thanks to the meticulous effort in organizing the relevant information and resources from the new Docs team, both Release Notes and Docs tracking have seen a smooth and successful transition. Finally, a very special thanks goes out to our release lead, Nina Polshakova, for her support throughout a successful release cycle, her advocacy, her efforts to ensure that everyone could contribute effectively, and her challenges to improve the release process. Project velocity The CNCF K8s DevStats project aggregates several interesting data points related to the velocity of Kubernetes and various subprojects. This includes everything from individual contributions, to the number of companies contributing, and illustrates the depth and breadth of effort that goes into evolving this ecosystem. During the v1.33 release cycle, which spanned 15 weeks from January 13 to April 23, 2025, Kubernetes received contributions from as many as 121 different companies and 570 individuals (as of writing, a few weeks before the release date). In the wider cloud native ecosystem, the figure goes up to 435 companies counting 2400 total contributors. You can find the data source in this dashboard. Compared to the velocity data from previous release, v1.32, we see a similar level of contribution from companies and individuals, indicating strong community interest and engagement. Note that, \u201ccontribution\u201d counts when someone makes a commit, code review, comment, creates an issue or PR, reviews a PR (including blogs and documentation) or comments on issues and PRs.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades. Additionally, a 30-second grace\nperiod has been introduced before the <code>kubelet</code> cleans up after unregistering a driver, providing\nbetter support for drivers that do not use rolling updates.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP-4381: DRA: structured parameters</a> by WG\nDevice Management, a cross-functional team including SIG Node, SIG Scheduling, and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-allocation-dra-for-network-interfaces\">Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) for network interfaces</h3>\n<p>The standardized reporting of network interface data via DRA, introduced in v1.32, has graduated to\nbeta in v1.33. This enables more native Kubernetes network integrations, simplifying the development\nand management of networking devices. This was covered previously in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/11/kubernetes-v1-32-release/#dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status\">v1.32 release announcement blog</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4817\">KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data</a>\nled by SIG Network, SIG Node, and WG Device Management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"handle-unscheduled-pods-early-when-scheduler-does-not-have-any-pod-on-activeq\">Handle unscheduled pods early when scheduler does not have any pod on activeQ</h3>\n<p>This feature improves queue scheduling behavior. Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays. This improvement is particularly\nbeneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a more\nefficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4832\">KEP-4832: Asynchronous preemption in the scheduler</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clustertrustbundles\">ClusterTrustBundles</h3>\n<p>ClusterTrustBundle, a cluster-scoped resource designed for holding X.509 trust anchors (root\ncertificates), has graduated to beta in v1.33. This API makes it easier for in-cluster certificate\nsigners to publish and communicate X.509 trust anchors to cluster workloads.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3257\">KEP-3257: ClusterTrustBundles (previously Trust Anchor Sets)</a> led by SIG\nAuth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fine-grained-supplementalgroups-control\">Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control</h3>\n<p>Introduced in v1.31, this feature graduates to beta in v1.33 and is now enabled by default. Provided\nthat your cluster has the <code>SupplementalGroupsPolicy</code> feature gate enabled, the\n<code>supplementalGroupsPolicy</code> field within a Pod's <code>securityContext</code> supports two policies: the default\nMerge policy maintains backward compatibility by combining specified groups with those from the\ncontainer image's <code>/etc/group</code> file, whereas the new Strict policy applies only to explicitly\ndefined groups.</p>\n<p>This enhancement helps to address security concerns where implicit group memberships from container\nimages could lead to unintended file access permissions and bypass policy controls.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3619\">KEP-3619: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-mounting-images-as-volumes\">Support for mounting images as volumes</h3>\n<p>Support for using Open Container Initiative (OCI) images as volumes in Pods, introduced in v1.31,\nhas graduated to beta. This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release\nin v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and has moved to on-by-default\nbeta as part of v1.33.</p>\n<p>This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify <code>pod.spec.hostUsers</code> to opt\nin. As highlighted in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/03/12/kubernetes-1-30-upcoming-changes/\">v1.30 sneak peek blog</a>, this is an important\nmilestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods</a> led\nby SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-procmount-option\">Pod <code>procMount</code> option</h3>\n<p>The <code>procMount</code> option, introduced as alpha in v1.12, and off-by-default beta in v1.31, has moved to\nan on-by-default beta in v1.33. This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node. It optimizes CPU\nresource allocation by balancing workloads across multiple NUMA nodes, thereby improving performance\nand resource utilization in multi-NUMA systems.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2902\">KEP-2902: Add CPUManager policy option to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes instead of packing them</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zero-second-sleeps-for-container-prestop-hooks\">Zero-second sleeps for container PreStop hooks</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.29 introduced a Sleep action for the <code>preStop</code> lifecycle hook in Pods, allowing\ncontainers to pause for a specified duration before termination. This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature. This\nallows defining a no-op <code>preStop</code> hook, which is useful when a <code>preStop</code> hook is required but no\ndelay is desired.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3960\">KEP-3960: Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4818\">KEP-4818: Allow zero value for Sleep Action of PreStop Hook</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internal-tooling-for-declarative-validation-of-kubernetes-native-types\">Internal tooling for declarative validation of Kubernetes-native types</h3>\n<p>Behind the scenes, the internals of Kubernetes are starting to use a new mechanism for validating\nobjects and changes to objects. Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

See the Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation and removal policy</a> for more details on\nthis process. Many of these deprecations and removals were announced in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/26/kubernetes-v1-33-upcoming-changes/\">Deprecations and Removals blog post</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"deprecation-of-the-stable-endpoints-api\">Deprecation of the stable Endpoints API</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/\">EndpointSlices</a> API has been stable since\nv1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled\nby default since v1.31, this field has been removed entirely in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4004\">KEP-4004: Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-in-tree-gitrepo-volume-driver\">Removal of in-tree gitRepo volume driver</h4>\n<p>The gitRepo volume type has been deprecated since v1.11, nearly 7 years ago. Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP. Support was fully\nremoved in v1.33.</p>\n<p>Please note that this does not affect\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/\">HostProcess containers</a>, which\nprovides host network as well as host level access. The KEP withdrawn in v1.33 was about providing\nthe host network only, which was never stable due to technical limitations with Windows networking\nlogic.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3503\">KEP-3503: Host network support for Windows pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\">Release notes</h2>\n<p>Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.33 release in our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is available for download on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.33.0\">GitHub</a> or on the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/\">Kubernetes download page</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started with Kubernetes, check out these <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/\">interactive tutorials</a> or run\nlocal Kubernetes clusters using <a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/\">minikube</a>.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades. Additionally, a 30-second grace\nperiod has been introduced before the <code>kubelet</code> cleans up after unregistering a driver, providing\nbetter support for drivers that do not use rolling updates.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP-4381: DRA: structured parameters</a> by WG\nDevice Management, a cross-functional team including SIG Node, SIG Scheduling, and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-allocation-dra-for-network-interfaces\">Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) for network interfaces</h3>\n<p>The standardized reporting of network interface data via DRA, introduced in v1.32, has graduated to\nbeta in v1.33. This enables more native Kubernetes network integrations, simplifying the development\nand management of networking devices.

Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays. This improvement is particularly\nbeneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a more\nefficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4832\">KEP-4832: Asynchronous preemption in the scheduler</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clustertrustbundles\">ClusterTrustBundles</h3>\n<p>ClusterTrustBundle, a cluster-scoped resource designed for holding X.509 trust anchors (root\ncertificates), has graduated to beta in v1.33.

Provided\nthat your cluster has the <code>SupplementalGroupsPolicy</code> feature gate enabled, the\n<code>supplementalGroupsPolicy</code> field within a Pod's <code>securityContext</code> supports two policies: the default\nMerge policy maintains backward compatibility by combining specified groups with those from the\ncontainer image's <code>/etc/group</code> file, whereas the new Strict policy applies only to explicitly\ndefined groups.</p>\n<p>This enhancement helps to address security concerns where implicit group memberships from container\nimages could lead to unintended file access permissions and bypass policy controls.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3619\">KEP-3619: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-mounting-images-as-volumes\">Support for mounting images as volumes</h3>\n<p>Support for using Open Container Initiative (OCI) images as volumes in Pods, introduced in v1.31,\nhas graduated to beta. This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods.

As highlighted in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/03/12/kubernetes-1-30-upcoming-changes/\">v1.30 sneak peek blog</a>, this is an important\nmilestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods</a> led\nby SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-procmount-option\">Pod <code>procMount</code> option</h3>\n<p>The <code>procMount</code> option, introduced as alpha in v1.12, and off-by-default beta in v1.31, has moved to\nan on-by-default beta in v1.33. This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node.

This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature. This\nallows defining a no-op <code>preStop</code> hook, which is useful when a <code>preStop</code> hook is required but no\ndelay is desired.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3960\">KEP-3960: Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4818\">KEP-4818: Allow zero value for Sleep Action of PreStop Hook</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internal-tooling-for-declarative-validation-of-kubernetes-native-types\">Internal tooling for declarative validation of Kubernetes-native types</h3>\n<p>Behind the scenes, the internals of Kubernetes are starting to use a new mechanism for validating\nobjects and changes to objects. Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate.

Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP. Support was fully\nremoved in v1.33.</p>\n<p>Please note that this does not affect\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/\">HostProcess containers</a>, which\nprovides host network as well as host level access.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades.

Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays.

This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods.

This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node.

This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature.

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate.

Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades.

Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays.

This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods.

This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node.

This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature.

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate.

Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades.

Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays.

This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods.

This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node.

This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature.

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate.

Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP.

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our\ndevelopment cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are\nentering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>There are also several notable <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this\nrelease; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.33 logo: Octarine\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/k8s-1.33.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is <strong>Octarine: The Color of Magic</strong><sup>1</sup>, inspired by Terry\nPratchett\u2019s <em>Discworld</em> series. This release highlights the open source magic<sup>2</sup> that\nKubernetes enables across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched\natop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of\nAnkh-Morpork with 64 stars<sup>3</sup> in the background.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the\ncuriosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33\nrelease is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, <em>\u201cIt\u2019s still magic even if you know how it\u2019s done.\u201d</em>\nEven if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the\nrelease cycle, you\u2019ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 is a testament to the enduring power of open source innovation, where hundreds of\ncontributors<sup>4</sup> from around the world work together to create something truly\nextraordinary. Behind every new feature, the Kubernetes community works to maintain and improve the\nproject, ensuring it remains secure, reliable, and released on time. Each release builds upon the\nother, creating something greater than we could achieve alone.</p>\n<p><sub>1.

Here are a few select updates the\nRelease Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-sidecar-containers\">Stable: Sidecar containers</h3>\n<p>The sidecar pattern involves deploying separate auxiliary container(s) to handle extra capabilities\nin areas such as networking, logging, and metrics gathering. Sidecar containers graduate to stable\nin v1.33.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes implements sidecars as a special class of init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>,\nensuring that sidecars start before application containers, remain running throughout the pod's\nlifecycle, and terminate automatically after the main containers exit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sidecars can utilize probes (startup, readiness, liveness) to signal their operational\nstate, and their Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustments are aligned with primary containers to\nprevent premature termination under memory pressure.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/753\">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">Beta: In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>Workloads can be defined using APIs like Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. These describe the template\nfor the Pods that should run, including memory and CPU resources, as well as the replica count of\nthe number of Pods that should run. Workloads can be scaled horizontally by updating the Pod replica\ncount, or vertically by updating the resources required in the Pods container(s). Before this\nenhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these\ndetails within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without\nrestarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It was\nreleased as alpha in v1.27, and has graduated to beta in v1.33. This opens up various possibilities\nfor vertical scale-up of stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the\ntraffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup, which can then be reduced once\nthe initial setup is complete.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>\nled by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-new-configuration-option-for-kubectl-with-kuberc-for-user-preferences\">Alpha: New configuration option for kubectl with <code>.kuberc</code> for user preferences</h3>\n<p>In v1.33, <code>kubectl</code> introduces a new alpha feature with opt-in configuration file <code>.kuberc</code> for user\npreferences. This file can contain <code>kubectl</code> aliases and overrides (e.g. defaulting to use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>), while leaving cluster\ncredentials and host information in kubeconfig. This separation allows sharing the same user\npreferences for <code>kubectl</code> interaction, regardless of target cluster and kubeconfig used.</p>\n<p>To enable this alpha feature, users can set the environment variable of <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC=true</code> and\ncreate a <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file. By default, <code>kubectl</code> looks for this file in\n<code>~/.kube/kuberc</code>. You can also specify an alternative location using the <code>--kuberc</code> flag, for\nexample: <code>kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP-3104: Separate kubectl user preferences from cluster configs</a> led by\nSIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs\">Backoff limits per index for indexed Jobs</h3>\n<p>\u200bThis release graduates a feature that allows setting backoff limits on a per-index basis for Indexed\nJobs. Traditionally, the <code>backoffLimit</code> parameter in Kubernetes Jobs specifies the number of retries\nbefore considering the entire Job as failed. This enhancement allows each index within an Indexed\nJob to have its own backoff limit, providing more granular control over retry behavior for\nindividual tasks. This ensures that the failure of specific indices does not prematurely terminate\nthe entire Job, allowing the other indices to continue processing independently.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-success-policy\">Job success policy</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>, users can specify which pod indexes must succeed (<code>succeededIndexes</code>),\nhow many pods must succeed (<code>succeededCount</code>), or a combination of both. This feature benefits\nvarious workloads, including simulations where partial completion is sufficient, and leader-worker\npatterns where only the leader's success determines the Job's overall outcome.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a> led\nby SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bound-serviceaccount-token-security-improvements\">Bound ServiceAccount token security improvements</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced features such as including a unique token identifier (i.e.\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7\">JWT ID Claim, also known as JTI</a>) and\nnode information within the tokens, enabling more precise validation and auditing. Additionally, it\nsupports node-specific restrictions, ensuring that tokens are only usable on designated nodes,\nthereby reducing the risk of token misuse and potential security breaches. These improvements, now\ngenerally available, aim to enhance the overall security posture of service account tokens within\nKubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4193\">KEP-4193: Bound service account token improvements</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subresource-support-in-kubectl\">Subresource support in kubectl</h3>\n<p>The <code>--subresource</code> argument is now generally available for kubectl subcommands such as <code>get</code>,\n<code>patch</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>replace</code>, allowing users to fetch and update subresources for all\nresources that support them. To learn more about the subresources supported, visit the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/#subresources\">kubectl reference</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2590\">KEP-2590: Add subresource support to kubectl</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-service-cidrs\">Multiple Service CIDRs</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduced a new implementation of allocation logic for Service IPs. Across the\nwhole cluster, every Service of <code>type: ClusterIP</code> must have a unique IP address assigned to it.\nTrying to create a Service with a specific cluster IP that has already been allocated will return an\nerror. The updated IP address allocator logic uses two newly stable API objects: <code>ServiceCIDR</code> and\n<code>IPAddress</code>. Now generally available, these APIs allow cluster administrators to dynamically\nincrease the number of IP addresses available for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services (by creating new\nServiceCIDR objects).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1880\">KEP-1880: Multiple Service CIDRs</a> led by SIG\nNetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nftables-backend-for-kube-proxy\"><code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>The <code>nftables</code> backend for kube-proxy is now stable, adding a new implementation that significantly\nimproves performance and scalability for Services implementation within Kubernetes clusters. For\ncompatibility reasons, <code>iptables</code> remains the default on Linux nodes. Check the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">migration guide</a>\nif you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3866\">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a> led\nby SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topology-aware-routing-with-trafficdistribution-preferclose\">Topology aware routing with <code>trafficDistribution: PreferClose</code></h3>\n<p>This release graduates topology-aware routing and traffic distribution to GA, which would allow us\nto optimize service traffic in multi-zone clusters. The topology-aware hints in EndpointSlices would\nenable components like kube-proxy to prioritize routing traffic to endpoints within the same zone,\nthereby reducing latency and cross-zone data transfer costs. Building upon this,\n<code>trafficDistribution</code> field is added to the Service specification, with the <code>PreferClose</code> option\ndirecting traffic to the nearest available endpoints based on network topology. This configuration\nenhances performance and cost-efficiency by minimizing inter-zone communication.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4444\">KEP-4444: Traffic Distribution for Services</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2433\">KEP-2433: Topology Aware Routing</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-to-reject-non-smt-aligned-workload\">Options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</h3>\n<p>This feature added policy options to the CPU Manager, enabling it to reject workloads that do not\nalign with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) configurations. This enhancement, now generally\navailable, ensures that when a pod requests exclusive use of CPU cores, the CPU Manager can enforce\nallocation of entire core pairs (comprising primary and sibling threads) on SMT-enabled systems,\nthereby preventing scenarios where workloads share CPU resources in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2625\">KEP-2625: node: cpumanager: add options to reject non SMT-aligned workload</a>\nled by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-pod-affinity-or-anti-affinity-using-matchlabelkeys-and-mismatchlabelkeys\">Defining Pod affinity or anti-affinity using <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>matchLabelKeys</code> and <code>mismatchLabelKeys</code> fields are available in Pod affinity terms, enabling\nusers to finely control the scope where Pods are expected to co-exist (Affinity) or not\n(AntiAffinity). These newly stable options complement the existing <code>labelSelector</code> mechanism. The\naffinity fields facilitate enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates, as well as isolation\nof services managed by tools or controllers based on global configurations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3633\">KEP-3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considering-taints-and-tolerations-when-calculating-pod-topology-spread-skew\">Considering taints and tolerations when calculating Pod topology spread skew</h3>\n<p>This enhanced <code>PodTopologySpread</code> by introducing two fields: <code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> and\n<code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code>. These fields allow users to specify whether node affinity rules and node taints\nshould be considered when calculating pod distribution across nodes. By default,\n<code>nodeAffinityPolicy</code> is set to <code>Honor</code>, meaning only nodes matching the pod's node affinity or\nselector are included in the distribution calculation. The <code>nodeTaintsPolicy</code> defaults to <code>Ignore</code>,\nindicating that node taints are not considered unless specified. This enhancement provides finer\ncontrol over pod placement, ensuring that pods are scheduled on nodes that meet both affinity and\ntaint toleration requirements, thereby preventing scenarios where pods remain pending due to\nunsatisfied constraints.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3094\">KEP-3094: Take taints/tolerations into consideration when calculating PodTopologySpread skew</a>\nled by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-populators\">Volume populators</h3>\n<p>After being released as beta in v1.24, <em>volume populators</em> have graduated to GA in v1.33. This newly\nstable feature provides a way to allow users to pre-populate volumes with data from various sources,\nand not just from PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) clones or volume snapshots. The mechanism relies on\nthe <code>dataSourceRef</code> field within a PersistentVolumeClaim. This field offers more flexibility than\nthe existing <code>dataSource</code> field, and allows for custom resources to be used as data sources.</p>\n<p>A special controller, <code>volume-data-source-validator</code>, validates these data source references,\nalongside a newly stable CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for an API kind named VolumePopulator. The\nVolumePopulator API allows volume populator controllers to register the types of data sources they\nsupport. You need to set up your cluster with the appropriate CRD in order to use volume populators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1495\">KEP-1495: Generic data populators</a> led by\nSIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-honor-persistentvolume-reclaim-policy\">Always honor PersistentVolume reclaim policy</h3>\n<p>This enhancement addressed an issue where the Persistent Volume (PV) reclaim policy is not\nconsistently honored, leading to potential storage resource leaks. Specifically, if a PV is deleted\nbefore its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the &quot;Delete&quot; reclaim policy may not be\nexecuted, leaving the underlying storage assets intact. To mitigate this, Kubernetes now sets\nfinalizers on relevant PVs, ensuring that the reclaim policy is enforced regardless of the deletion\nsequence. This enhancement prevents unintended retention of storage resources and maintains\nconsistency in PV lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2644\">KEP-2644: Always Honor PersistentVolume Reclaim Policy</a> led by SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing the return traffic routed through load balancers\nto bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client; reducing load on the load balancer\nand also reducing overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read\n<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially introduced in v1.14, support for DSR has been promoted to beta by SIG Windows as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP-5100: Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) and overlay networking in Windows kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-parameter-support\">Structured parameter support</h3>\n<p>While structured parameter support continues as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.33, this core part\nof Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) has seen significant improvements. A new v1beta2 version\nsimplifies the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> API, and regular users with the namespaced cluster <code>edit</code> role can\nnow use DRA.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> now includes seamless upgrade support, enabling drivers deployed as DaemonSets to use\na rolling update mechanism. For DRA implementations, this prevents the deletion and re-creation of\nResourceSlices, allowing them to remain unchanged during upgrades.

Behind the scenes, the scheduler achieves this by\npopping pods from the <em>backoffQ</em>, which are not backed off due to errors, when the <em>activeQ</em> is\nempty. Previously, the scheduler would become idle even when the <em>activeQ</em> was empty; this\nenhancement improves scheduling efficiency by preventing that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5142\">KEP-5142: Pop pod from backoffQ when activeQ is empty</a> led by SIG\nScheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler\">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>\n<p>Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by evicting lower-priority ones.\nAsynchronous Preemption, introduced in v1.32 as alpha, has graduated to beta in v1.33. With this\nenhancement, heavy operations such as API calls to delete pods are processed in parallel, allowing\nthe scheduler to continue scheduling other pods without delays.

This feature allows users to specify an image reference as a volume in a Pod\nwhile reusing it as a volume mount within containers. It opens up the possibility of packaging the\nvolume data separately, and sharing them among containers in a Pod without including them in the\nmain image, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying image creation.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: VolumeSource: OCI Artifact and/or Image</a> led by SIG Node and SIG\nStorage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs as of writing is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security\nimprovement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for\nPods.

This enhancement improves Pod isolation by allowing users to\nfine-tune access to the <code>/proc</code> filesystem. Specifically, it adds a field to the Pod\n<code>securityContext</code> that lets you override the default behavior of masking and marking certain <code>/proc</code>\npaths as read-only. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users want to run unprivileged\ncontainers inside the Kubernetes Pod using user namespaces. Normally, the container runtime (via the\nCRI implementation) starts the outer container with strict <code>/proc</code> mount settings. However, to\nsuccessfully run nested containers with an unprivileged Pod, users need a mechanism to relax those\ndefaults, and this feature provides exactly that.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4265\">KEP-4265: add ProcMount option</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpumanager-policy-to-distribute-cpus-across-numa-nodes\">CPUManager policy to distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes</h3>\n<p>This feature adds a new policy option for the CPU Manager to distribute CPUs across Non-Uniform\nMemory Access (NUMA) nodes, rather than concentrating them on a single node.

This provides a straightforward\nmethod to delay container shutdown, facilitating tasks such as connection draining or cleanup\noperations.</p>\n<p>The Sleep action in a <code>preStop</code> hook can now accept a zero-second duration as a beta feature.

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces <code>validation-gen</code>, an internal tool that\nKubernetes contributors use to generate declarative validation rules. The overall goal is to improve\nthe robustness and maintainability of API validations by enabling developers to specify validation\nconstraints declaratively, reducing manual coding errors and ensuring consistency across the\ncodebase.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP-5073: Declarative Validation Of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen</a>\nled by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.33 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>This feature introduces configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers, which dampens scaling\nreactions to small metric variations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951: Configurable tolerance for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers</a> led by\nSIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-container-restart-delay\">Configurable container restart delay</h3>\n<p>Introduced as alpha1 in v1.32, this feature provides a set of kubelet-level configurations to\nfine-tune how CrashLoopBackOff is handled.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4603\">KEP-4603: Tune CrashLoopBackOff</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-container-stop-signals\">Custom container stop signals</h3>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.33, stop signals could only be set in container image definitions (for example,\nvia the <code>StopSignal</code> configuration field in the image metadata). If you wanted to modify termination\nbehavior, you needed to build a custom container image. By enabling the (alpha)\n<code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in Kubernetes v1.33, you can now define custom stop signals\ndirectly within Pod specifications. This is defined in the container's <code>lifecycle.stopSignal</code> field\nand requires the Pod's <code>spec.os.name</code> field to be present. If unspecified, containers fall back to\nthe image-defined stop signal (if present), or the container runtime default (typically SIGTERM for\nLinux).</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4960\">KEP-4960: Container Stop Signals</a> led by SIG\nNode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-enhancements-galore\">DRA enhancements galore!</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 continues to develop Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with features designed for\ntoday\u2019s complex infrastructures. DRA is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and\ncontainers inside a pod. Typically those resources are devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and network\nadapters.</p>\n<p>The following are all the alpha DRA feature gates introduced in v1.33:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Node taints, by enabling the <code>DRADeviceTaints</code> feature gate, devices support taints and\ntolerations. An admin or a control plane component can taint devices to limit their usage.\nScheduling of pods which depend on those devices can be paused while a taint exists and/or pods\nusing a tainted device can be evicted.</li>\n<li>By enabling the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code>, DeviceRequests get a new field named\n<code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows the user to specify that a request may\nbe satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if some specific hardware is\nnot available.</li>\n<li>With feature gate <code>DRAAdminAccess</code> enabled, only users authorized to create ResourceClaim or\nResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>\ncan use the <code>adminAccess</code> field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the <code>adminAccess</code>\nfeature.</li>\n<li>While it has been possible to consume device partitions since v1.31, vendors had to pre-partition\ndevices and advertise them accordingly. By enabling the <code>DRAPartitionableDevices</code> feature gate in\nv1.33, device vendors can advertise multiple partitions, including overlapping ones. The\nKubernetes scheduler will choose the partition based on workload requests, and prevent the\nallocation of conflicting partitions simultaneously. This feature gives vendors the ability to\ndynamically create partitions at allocation time. The allocation and dynamic partitioning are\nautomatic and transparent to users, enabling improved resource utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature gates have no effect unless you also enable the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature\ngate.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5055\">KEP-5055: DRA: device taints and tolerations</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP-4816: DRA: Prioritized Alternatives in Device Requests</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP-5018: DRA: AdminAccess for ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4815\">KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices</a>, led by SIG\nNode, SIG Scheduling and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"robust-image-pull-policy-to-authenticate-images-for-ifnotpresent-and-never\">Robust image pull policy to authenticate images for <code>IfNotPresent</code> and <code>Never</code></h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to ensure that kubelet requires an image pull authentication check for\neach new set of credentials, regardless of whether the image is already present on the node.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535: Ensure secret pulled images</a> led\nby SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-topology-labels-are-available-via-downward-api\">Node topology labels are available via downward API</h3>\n<p>This feature enables Node topology labels to be exposed via the downward API.

While the original Endpoints API was\nsimple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network\nendpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making\nthe original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation affects only those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts;\nthese users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with\nmore details on the deprecation implications and migration plans.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h4>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the v1.31\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>,\nthe <code>.status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field for Nodes was removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate.

Since its deprecation,\nthere have been security concerns, including how gitRepo volume types can be exploited to gain\nremote code execution as root on the nodes. In v1.33, the in-tree driver code is removed.</p>\n<p>There are alternatives such as git-sync and initContainers. <code>gitVolumes</code> in the Kubernetes API is\nnot removed, and thus pods with <code>gitRepo</code> volumes will be admitted by kube-apiserver, but kubelets\nwith the feature-gate <code>GitRepoVolumeDriver</code> set to false will not run them and return an appropriate\nerror to the user. This allows users to opt-in to re-enabling the driver for 3 versions to give them\nenough time to fix workloads.</p>\n<p>The feature gate in kubelet and in-tree plugin code is planned to be removed in the v1.39 release.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5040\">KEP-5040: Remove gitRepo volume driver</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h4>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density\nby allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as\nalpha with v1.26, but because it faced unexpected containerd behaviours and alternative solutions\nwere available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP.

      "summary": "Kubernetes multicontainer pods utilize sidecars to enhance application functionality in cloud-native architectures.",
      "summary_original": "As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern\u2014a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code. The origins of the sidecar pattern Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems. Kubernetes implementation In Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1.29.0, which introduced native support for sidecars. Sidecar containers can now be defined within a Pod manifest using the spec.initContainers field. What makes it a sidecar container is that you specify it with restartPolicy: Always. You can see an example of this below, which is a partial snippet of the full Kubernetes manifest: initContainers: - name: logshipper image: alpine:latest restartPolicy: Always command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -F /opt/logs.txt'] volumeMounts: - name: data mountPath: /opt That field name, spec.initContainers may sound confusing. How come when you want to define a sidecar container, you have to put an entry in the spec.initContainers array? spec.initContainers are run to completion just before main application starts, so they\u2019re one-off, whereas sidecars often run in parallel to the main app container. It\u2019s the spec.initContainers with restartPolicy:Always which differs classic init containers from Kubernetes-native sidecar containers and ensures they are always up. When to embrace (or avoid) sidecars While the sidecar pattern can be useful in many cases, it is generally not the preferred approach unless the use case justifies it. Adding a sidecar increases complexity, resource consumption, and potential network latency. Instead, simpler alternatives such as built-in libraries or shared infrastructure should be considered first. Deploy a sidecar when: You need to extend application functionality without touching the original code Implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring or security Working with legacy applications requiring modern networking capabilities Designing microservices that demand independent scaling and updates Proceed with caution if: Resource efficiency is your primary concern Minimal network latency is critical Simpler alternatives exist You want to minimize troubleshooting complexity Four essential multi-container patterns Init container pattern The Init container pattern is used to execute (often critical) setup tasks before the main application container starts. Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion and then terminate, ensuring that preconditions for the main application are met. Ideal for: Preparing configurations Loading secrets Verifying dependency availability Running database migrations The init container ensures your application starts in a predictable, controlled environment without code modifications. Ambassador pattern An ambassador container provides Pod-local helper services that expose a simple way to access a network service. Commonly, ambassador containers send network requests on behalf of a an application container and take care of challenges such as service discovery, peer identity verification, or encryption in transit. Perfect when you need to: Offload client connectivity concerns Implement language-agnostic networking features Add security layers like TLS Create robust circuit breakers and retry mechanisms Configuration helper A configuration helper sidecar provides configuration updates to an application dynamically, ensuring it always has access to the latest settings without disrupting the service. Often the helper needs to provide an initial configuration before the application would be able to start successfully. Use cases: Fetching environment variables and secrets Polling configuration changes Decoupling configuration management from application logic Adapter pattern An adapter (or sometimes fa\u00e7ade) container enables interoperability between the main application container and external services. It does this by translating data formats, protocols, or APIs. Strengths: Transforming legacy data formats Bridging communication protocols Facilitating integration between mismatched services Wrap-up While sidecar patterns offer tremendous flexibility, they're not a silver bullet. Each added sidecar introduces complexity, consumes resources, and potentially increases operational overhead. Always evaluate simpler alternatives first. The key is strategic implementation: use sidecars as precision tools to solve specific architectural challenges, not as a default approach. When used correctly, they can improve security, networking, and configuration management in containerized environments. Choose wisely, implement carefully, and let your sidecars elevate your container ecosystem.",

      "summary": "The Kubernetes project's upcoming v1.",
      "summary_original": "As the release of Kubernetes v1.33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement. Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes. Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation. Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place. Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable, or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the deprecation guide. Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.33 Deprecation of the stable Endpoints API The EndpointSlices API has been stable since v1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation. This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans in the coming weeks. You can find more in KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints. Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the release announcement, the status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field will be removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, the v1.33 release will remove this field entirely. You can find more in KEP-4004: Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field. Removal of host network support for Windows pods Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node\u2019s networking namespace. The original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but as it faced unexpected containerd behaviours, and alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated KEP. We're expecting to see support fully removed in v1.33. You can find more in KEP-3503: Host network support for Windows pods. Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33 As authors of this article, we picked one improvement as the most significant change to call out! Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods One of the oldest open KEPs today is KEP-127, Pod security improvement by using Linux User namespaces for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default. This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify pod.spec.hostUsers to opt in. As highlighted in the v1.30 sneak peek blog, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities. You can find more in KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods. Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvements The following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods When provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod\u2019s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's spec were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement. But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them? The KEP-1287 is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33. You can find more in KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources. DRA\u2019s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to beta The devices field in ResourceClaim status, originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities. For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status document. Also, you can find more about the planned enhancement in KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data. Ordered namespace deletion This KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes\u2019s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions. You can find more in KEP-5080: Ordered namespace deletion. Enhancements for indexed job management These two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. KEP-3850 provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes. Also, KEP-3998 extends Job API to define conditions for making an indexed job as successfully completed when not all indexes are succeeded. You can find more in KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs and KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy. Want to know more? New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.33 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.

This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable, or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy.

The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead.

This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.</p>\n<p>This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify <code>pod.spec.hostUsers</code> to opt in. As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/03/12/kubernetes-1-30-upcoming-changes/\">v1.30 sneak peek blog</a>, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"selected-other-kubernetes-v1-33-improvements\">Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvements</h2>\n<p>The following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>When provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod\u2019s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-s-resourceclaim-device-status-graduates-to-beta\">DRA\u2019s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to beta</h3>\n<p>The <code>devices</code> field in ResourceClaim <code>status</code>, originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#resourceclaim-device-status\">Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status</a> document.</p>\n<p>Also, you can find more about the planned enhancement in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4817\">KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordered-namespace-deletion\">Ordered namespace deletion</h3>\n<p>This KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes\u2019s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5080\">KEP-5080: Ordered namespace deletion</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhancements-for-indexed-job-management\">Enhancements for indexed job management</h3>\n<p>These two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850</a> provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes.

Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete.

This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.</p>\n<p>This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify <code>pod.spec.hostUsers</code> to opt in.

      "title": "Fresh Swap Features for Linux Users in Kubernetes 1.32",
      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/",
      "summary": "Kubernetes has introduced Swap support for Linux nodes in version 1.",
      "summary_original": "Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature. It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node\u2019s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time. However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments. In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta. The Beta version was a drastic leap forward. Not only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way, but it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests which include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more. It also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the LimitedSwap behavior which sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation support (through the /metrics/resource endpoint) and Summary API for VerticalPodAutoscalers (through the /stats/summary endpoint), and more. Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA. Currently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability, enhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback, polishing the feature and making it stable. For example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods cannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use. In addition, the UnlimitedSwap behavior was removed since it might compromise the node's health. Secret content protection against swapping has also been introduced (see relevant security-risk section for more info). To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled is more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings. That said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning. In the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways, such as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more! How do I use it? In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the failSwapOn field must be set to false on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated --fail-swap-on command line flag must be deactivated. It is possible to configure the memorySwap.swapBehavior option to define the manner in which a node utilizes swap memory. For instance, # this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file memorySwap: swapBehavior: LimitedSwap The currently available configuration options for swapBehavior are: NoSwap (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap. However, processes outside of Kubernetes' scope, like system daemons (such as kubelet itself!) can utilize swap. This behavior is beneficial for protecting the node from system-level memory spikes, but it does not safeguard the workloads themselves from such spikes. LimitedSwap: Kubernetes workloads can utilize swap memory, but with certain limitations. The amount of swap available to a Pod is determined automatically, based on the proportion of the memory requested relative to the node's total memory. Only non-high-priority Pods under the Burstable Quality of Service (QoS) tier are permitted to use swap. For more details, see the section below. If configuration for memorySwap is not specified, by default the kubelet will apply the same behaviour as the NoSwap setting. On Linux nodes, Kubernetes only supports running with swap enabled for hosts that use cgroup v2. On cgroup v1 systems, all Kubernetes workloads are not allowed to use swap memory. Install a swap-enabled cluster with kubeadm Before you begin It is required for this demo that the kubeadm tool be installed, following the steps outlined in the kubeadm installation guide. If swap is already enabled on the node, cluster creation may proceed. If swap is not enabled, please refer to the provided instructions for enabling swap. Create a swap file and turn swap on I'll demonstrate creating 4GiB of swap, both in the encrypted and unencrypted case. Setting up unencrypted swap An unencrypted swap file can be set up as follows. # Allocate storage and restrict access fallocate --length 4GiB /swapfile chmod 600 /swapfile # Format the swap space mkswap /swapfile # Activate the swap space for paging swapon /swapfile Setting up encrypted swap An encrypted swap file can be set up as follows. Bear in mind that this example uses the cryptsetup binary (which is available on most Linux distributions). # Allocate storage and restrict access fallocate --length 4GiB /swapfile chmod 600 /swapfile # Create an encrypted device backed by the allocated storage cryptsetup --type plain --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 256 -d /dev/urandom open /swapfile cryptswap # Format the swap space mkswap /dev/mapper/cryptswap # Activate the swap space for paging swapon /dev/mapper/cryptswap Verify that swap is enabled Swap can be verified to be enabled with both swapon -s command or the free command > swapon -s Filename Type Size Used Priority /dev/dm-0 partition 4194300 0 -2 > free -h total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 3.8Gi 1.3Gi 249Mi 25Mi 2.5Gi 2.5Gi Swap: 4.0Gi 0B 4.0Gi Enable swap on boot After setting up swap, to start the swap file at boot time, you either set up a systemd unit to activate (encrypted) swap, or you add a line similar to /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 into /etc/fstab. Set up a Kubernetes cluster that uses swap-enabled nodes To make things clearer, here is an example kubeadm configuration file kubeadm-config.yaml for the swap enabled cluster. --- apiVersion: \"kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3\" kind: InitConfiguration --- apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: KubeletConfiguration failSwapOn: false memorySwap: swapBehavior: LimitedSwap Then create a single-node cluster using kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml. During init, there is a warning that swap is enabled on the node and in case the kubelet failSwapOn is set to true. We plan to remove this warning in a future release. How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap? The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant challenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any misconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific workload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented Swap with automatic configuration of limitations. With LimitedSwap, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e. BestEffort/Guaranteed QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory. BestEffort QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack information regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe allocation of swap memory. Conversely, Guaranteed QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the precise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available. To maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees, these Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when LimitedSwap is in effect. In addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory they consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use. Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms: nodeTotalMemory: The total amount of physical memory available on the node. totalPodsSwapAvailable: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use). containerMemoryRequest: The container's memory request. Swap limitation is configured as: (containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its memory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods. It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to opt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits. Containers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory. How does it work? There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node. When swap is already provisioned and available on a node, the kubelet is able to be configured so that: It can start with swap on. It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory to Kubernetes workloads by default. Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the memorySwap in the KubeletConfiguration. As a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the presence of swap memory by setting memorySwap.swapBehavior. The kubelet employs the CRI (container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to configure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as memory.swap.max) in a manner that will enable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups, the container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup. How can I monitor swap? Node and container level metric statistics Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics, which can be accessed at the /metrics/resource (which is used mainly by monitoring tools like Prometheus) and /stats/summary (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints. This allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to monitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using LimitedSwap. Additionally, a machine_swap_bytes metric has been added to cadvisor to show the total physical swap capacity of the machine. See this page for more info. Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Node Feature Discovery is a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration. It can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap. As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap, use the following command: kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}' This will result in an output similar to: k8s-worker1: true k8s-worker2: true k8s-worker3: false In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes k8s-worker1 and k8s-worker2, but not on k8s-worker3. Caveats Having swap available on a system reduces predictability. While swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data back to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude, which can cause unexpected performance regressions. Furthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure. Enabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors, where Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap. In addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for, and due to unexpected packing configurations, the scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage. This heightens the risk of noisy neighbors. The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage. When swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O operations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with I/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives or NVMe. As swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency priority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the recommended practices section below. Memory-backed volumes On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as secret volume mounts, or emptyDir with medium: Memory) are implemented with a tmpfs filesystem. The contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should not be swapped to disk. To ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the noswap tmpfs option is being used. The Linux kernel officially supports the noswap option from version 6.3 (more info can be found in Linux Kernel Version Requirements). However, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older Linux versions as well. In order to verify whether the node supports the noswap option, the kubelet will do the following: If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the noswap option will be assumed to be supported. Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the noswap option at startup. If kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, noswap will be assumed to not be supported, hence will not be used. A kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk. If kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the noswap option will be used. If the noswap option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry, then continue its execution. It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space. See the section above with an example for setting unencrypted swap. However, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet; rather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level. It is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk. Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster Disable swap for system-critical daemons During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance of system-critical daemons and services might degrade. This implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual. If this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice to prevent swapping (i.e., set memory.swap.max=0). Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency Swap can increase the I/O load on a node. When memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out, system-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may experience performance degradation. To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency. For non-systemd users, setting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised. This can be achieved by setting io.latency for the system slice, thereby granting it higher I/O priority. See cgroup's documentation for more info. Swap and control plane nodes The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured. The control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled. The main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance. Use of a dedicated disk for swap It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition. If swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere with system processes that need to write to disk. When they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap, disrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads. Since swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases. Alternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device. Looking ahead As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately, paving the way for a feature GA. However, this is just the beginning. It's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality. In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities, including better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability, better debug abilities and more!

We plan to remove this warning in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-swap-limit-being-determined-with-limitedswap\">How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?</h2>\n<p>The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant\nchallenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial\ndesign of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory\nwas detected on a node.</p>\n<p>In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.\nThis provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.\nHowever, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p>\n<p>In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.\nThe Beta version was a drastic leap forward.\nNot only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,\nbut it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests\nwhich include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.\nIt also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> behavior\nwhich sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation\nsupport (through the <code>/metrics/resource</code> endpoint) and Summary API for\nVerticalPodAutoscalers (through the <code>/stats/summary</code> endpoint), and more.</p>\n<p>Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.\nCurrently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,\nenhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,\npolishing the feature and making it stable.\nFor example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods\ncannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.\nIn addition, the <code>UnlimitedSwap</code> behavior was removed since it might compromise\nthe node's health.\nSecret content protection against swapping has also been introduced\n(see relevant <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#memory-backed-volumes\">security-risk section</a> for more info).</p>\n<p>To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled\nis more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.\nThat said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.\nIn the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,\nsuch as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the <code>failSwapOn</code>\nfield must be set to <code>false</code> on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated\n<code>--fail-swap-on</code> command line flag must be deactivated.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure the <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code> option to define the\nmanner in which a node utilizes swap memory.\nFor instance,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">memorySwap</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">swapBehavior</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>LimitedSwap<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The currently available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NoSwap</code> (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.

We plan to remove this warning in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-swap-limit-being-determined-with-limitedswap\">How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?</h2>\n<p>The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant\nchallenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap

Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap

Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial\ndesign of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory\nwas detected on a node.</p>\n<p>In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.\nThis provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.\nHowever, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p>\n<p>In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.\nThe Beta version was a drastic leap forward.\nNot only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,\nbut it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests\nwhich include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.\nIt also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> behavior\nwhich sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation\nsupport (through the <code>/metrics/resource</code> endpoint) and Summary API for\nVerticalPodAutoscalers (through the <code>/stats/summary</code> endpoint), and more.</p>\n<p>Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.\nCurrently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,\nenhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,\npolishing the feature and making it stable.\nFor example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods\ncannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.\nIn addition, the <code>UnlimitedSwap</code> behavior was removed since it might compromise\nthe node's health.\nSecret content protection against swapping has also been introduced\n(see relevant <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#memory-backed-volumes\">security-risk section</a> for more info).</p>\n<p>To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled\nis more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.\nThat said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.\nIn the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,\nsuch as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the <code>failSwapOn</code>\nfield must be set to <code>false</code> on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated\n<code>--fail-swap-on</code> command line flag must be deactivated.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure the <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code> option to define the\nmanner in which a node utilizes swap memory.\nFor instance,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">memorySwap</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">swapBehavior</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>LimitedSwap<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The currently available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NoSwap</code> (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.

We plan to remove this warning in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-swap-limit-being-determined-with-limitedswap\">How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?</h2>\n<p>The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant\nchallenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial\ndesign of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory\nwas detected on a node.</p>\n<p>In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.\nThis provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.\nHowever, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p>\n<p>In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.\nThe Beta version was a drastic leap forward.\nNot only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,\nbut it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests\nwhich include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.\nIt also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> behavior\nwhich sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation\nsupport (through the <code>/metrics/resource</code> endpoint) and Summary API for\nVerticalPodAutoscalers (through the <code>/stats/summary</code> endpoint), and more.</p>\n<p>Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.\nCurrently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,\nenhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,\npolishing the feature and making it stable.\nFor example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods\ncannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.\nIn addition, the <code>UnlimitedSwap</code> behavior was removed since it might compromise\nthe node's health.\nSecret content protection against swapping has also been introduced\n(see relevant <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#memory-backed-volumes\">security-risk section</a> for more info).</p>\n<p>To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled\nis more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.\nThat said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.\nIn the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,\nsuch as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the <code>failSwapOn</code>\nfield must be set to <code>false</code> on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated\n<code>--fail-swap-on</code> command line flag must be deactivated.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure the <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code> option to define the\nmanner in which a node utilizes swap memory.\nFor instance,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">memorySwap</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">swapBehavior</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>LimitedSwap<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The currently available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NoSwap</code> (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.

Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) \u00d7 totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

      "summary": "Patches released for ingress-nginx address critical vulnerabilities affecting Kubernetes administrators using versions v1.",
      "summary_original": "Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and ingress-nginx v1.11.5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to protect your users and data. Background Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user\u2019s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn\u2019t. Vulnerabilities Patched Today Four of today\u2019s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets that are accessible to ingress-nginx. By default, ingress-nginx has access to all Secrets cluster-wide, so this can often lead to complete cluster takeover by any user or entity that has permission to create an Ingress. The most serious of today\u2019s vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974, rated 9.8 CVSS, allows anything on the Pod network to exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities via the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. This makes such vulnerabilities far more dangerous: ordinarily one would need to be able to create an Ingress object in the cluster, which is a fairly privileged action. When combined with today\u2019s other vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation. Today, we have released ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and ingress-nginx v1.11.5, which have fixes for all five of these vulnerabilities. Your next steps First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions. If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately. The best and easiest remedy is to upgrade to the new patch release of ingress-nginx. All five of today\u2019s vulnerabilities are fixed by installing today\u2019s patches. If you can\u2019t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm Reinstall, setting the Helm value controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false If you have installed ingress-nginx manually delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called ingress-nginx-admission edit the ingress-nginx-controller Deployment or Daemonset, removing --validating-webhook from the controller container\u2019s argument list If you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect. Conclusion, thanks, and further reading The ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe. Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.

When combined with today\u2019s other vulnerabilities, <strong>CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required</strong>. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation.</p>\n<p>Today, we have released <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.12.1\">ingress-nginx v1.12.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.11.5\">ingress-nginx v1.11.5</a>, which have fixes for all five of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-next-steps\">Your next steps</h2>\n<p>First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The best and easiest remedy is to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/\">upgrade to the new patch release of ingress-nginx</a>.</strong> All five of today\u2019s vulnerabilities are fixed by installing today\u2019s patches.</p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstall, setting the Helm value <code>controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx manually\n<ul>\n<li>delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called <code>ingress-nginx-admission</code></li>\n<li>edit the <code>ingress-nginx-controller</code> Deployment or Daemonset, removing <code>--validating-webhook</code> from the controller container\u2019s argument list</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-thanks-and-further-reading\">Conclusion, thanks, and further reading</h2>\n<p>The ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe.</p>\n<p>Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.</p>\n<p>For further information about the maintenance and future of ingress-nginx, please see this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/13002\">GitHub issue</a> and/or attend <a href=\"https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tcyc/\">James and Marco\u2019s KubeCon/CloudNativeCon EU 2025 presentation</a>.</p>\n<p>For further information about the specific vulnerabilities discussed in this article, please see the appropriate GitHub issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131005\">CVE-2025-24513</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131006\">CVE-2025-24514</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131007\">CVE-2025-1097</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131008\">CVE-2025-1098</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009\">CVE-2025-1974</a></p>\n<p><em>This blog post was revised in May 2025 to update the hyperlinks.</em></p>"

      "summary_original": "In our ongoing SIG Spotlight series, we dive into the heart of the Kubernetes project by talking to the leaders of its various Special Interest Groups (SIGs). This time, we focus on SIG Apps, the group responsible for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. Sandipan Panda (DevZero) had the opportunity to interview Maciej Szulik (Defense Unicorns) and Janet Kuo (Google), the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application management within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Introductions Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey within the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps? Maciej: Hey, my name is Maciej, and I\u2019m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you can also find me helping SIG CLI and also being one of the Steering Committee members. I\u2019ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various areas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl. Janet: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved with the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an amazing journey! My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My journey with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding rolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly involved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles. About SIG Apps All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet. Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives? What key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem? As described in our charter, we cover a broad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in short, means we\u2019re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the ups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes. Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken by SIG Apps? At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the challenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It\u2019s worth giving credit here to two working groups we\u2019ve sponsored over the past years: The Batch Working Group, which is looking at running HPC, AI/ML, and data analytics jobs on top of Kubernetes. The Serving Working Group, which is focusing on hardware-accelerated AI/ML inference. Best practices and challenges Sandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for Kubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application lifecycle management? Implementing health checks and readiness probes ensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved reliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing solutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and resolve issues quickly. Auto-scale your application based on resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your application can handle varying loads. Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job and CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use Operators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and lifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual intervention. Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them? The biggest challenge we\u2019re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and improvements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons behind those decisions. Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any recent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial for SIG Apps? The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions and the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to achieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven\u2019t considered or weren\u2019t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes. Contributing to SIG Apps Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG Apps, and what advice would you give them? We get the question, \"What good first issue might you recommend we start with?\" a lot :-) But unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start contributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read through the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that controller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your breakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want to search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining the problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix. Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to understand all the edge cases we\u2019ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you\u2019re successful with one controller, you\u2019ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again. Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback integrated into your work? We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our bi-weekly meetings. As long as you\u2019re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback about any of the core controllers, we\u2019re always happy to hear from everyone. Looking ahead Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management within Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends? Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working groups, each covering a different aspect of it. Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG? Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on Slack, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull requests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes great! SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are deployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving innovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of modern application developers and operators. Whether you\u2019re a new contributor or an experienced developer, there\u2019s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their SIG README and join their bi-weekly meetings. SIG Apps Mailing List SIG Apps on Slack",

      "summary": "The SIG etcd spotlight features interviews with key contributors to Kubernetes' distributed store solution, focusing on their roles and involvement in the project.",
      "summary_original": "In this SIG etcd spotlight we talked with James Blair, Marek Siarkowicz, Wenjia Zhang, and Benjamin Wang to learn a bit more about this Kubernetes Special Interest Group. Introducing SIG etcd Frederico: Hello, thank you for the time! Let\u2019s start with some introductions, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Benjamin: Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I work for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes & etcd & CSI (Container Storage Interface) because of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes & etcd (and also CSI) since 2020. James: Hey team, I\u2019m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a Specialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the Kubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project needed help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that \"you come for the technology, and stay for the people\": for me this is absolutely real, it\u2019s been a wonderful journey so far and I\u2019m excited to support our community moving forward. Marek: Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring a stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with SIG Instrumentation, where I created and led the Kubernetes Structured Logging effort. I'm still the main project lead for Kubernetes Metrics Server, providing crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago, right around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most scalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's history. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing. Wenjia: Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd maintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and etcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my job, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more importantly, the awesome open source community. Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is a very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation? Marek: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes, serving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and reliability issues. Creating a dedicated SIG allowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes, and ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape. Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just described being addressed, and to what extent? Marek: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and transparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals and PRRs (Production Readiness Reviews, which has improved our feature development and release cycle. Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from becoming a SIG? Marek: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like Prow and TestGrid. For large projects like etcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear tools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also help etcd. Wenjia: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation for addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes ecosystem. The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I\u2019d like to highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd contributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had greater collaboration with other SIGs like SIG API Machinery, SIG Scalability, SIG Testing, SIG Cluster Lifecycle, etc. This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes ecosystem. The formation of the etcd Operator Working Group under the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful collaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within Kubernetes. Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and community involvement in recent months? James: Yes -- as showing in our unique PR author data we recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction: Additionally, looking at our overall contributions across all etcd project repositories we are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity: The road ahead Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current priorities for SIG etcd? Marek: Reliability is always top of mind -\u2013 we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also working on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making etcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of course, scaling -\u2013 we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world. Benjamin: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure not only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve the understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points that the community cares about the most. Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with? Marek: SIG API Machinery, for sure \u2013 they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're constantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle \u2013 etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters, so we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group. Wenjia: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG Scalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with. Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the evolving cloud native landscape? Marek: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The cloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort. Getting involved Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how can they get involved? Marek: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our SIG etcd meetings, follow discussions on the etcd-dev mailing list, and check out our GitHub issues. We're always looking for people to review proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation. Wenjia: I love this question \ud83d\ude00 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing to SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help: Code Contributions: Bug Fixes: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase. Start with issues labeled \"good first issue\" or \"help wanted\" to find tasks that are suitable for newcomers. Feature Development: Contribute to the development of new features and enhancements. Check the etcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in. Testing and Code Reviews: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code changes, and providing feedback. Documentation: Improve etcd's documentation by adding new content, clarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for users and contributors. Community Support: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or Slack channels. Helping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution. Getting Started: Join the community: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack, attending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will help you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the people involved. Find a mentor: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider finding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned! Our first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will have a new round of mentorship program coming up. Start small: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even fixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix can be a great way to get involved. By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a critical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable experience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing! Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that you'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs? Marek: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established processes of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other SIGs, and focus on building a strong community. Wenjia: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS journey: Be patient: Open source development can take time. Don't get discouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if you encounter challenges. Be respectful: The etcd community values collaboration and respect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve common goals. Have fun: Contributing to open source should be enjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that you find fulfilling. Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!

Let\u2019s start with some introductions, could you tell us a\nbit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin:</strong> Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I\nwork for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes &amp; etcd &amp; CSI\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a>)\nbecause of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes &amp; etcd\n(and also CSI) since 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>James:</strong> Hey team, I\u2019m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it\u2019s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I\u2019m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I\u2019d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -\u2013 we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes.

Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure \u2013 they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle \u2013 etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them!

I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I\nwork for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes &amp; etcd &amp; CSI\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a>)\nbecause of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes &amp; etcd\n(and also CSI) since 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>James:</strong> Hey team, I\u2019m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it\u2019s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I\u2019m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I\u2019d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -\u2013 we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of\ncourse, scaling -\u2013 we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure\nnot only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve\nthe understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure \u2013 they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle \u2013 etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them!

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/",
      "summary": "A new nftables mode for kube-proxy in Kubernetes 1.",
      "summary_original": "A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the default.) Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services. In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to: # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain # KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then... -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT # etc... -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel to check it against all of the Service rules is O(n) in the number of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP address appears earlier or later in the KUBE-SERVICES chain). By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like this is to have a single rule, using a \"verdict map\" to do the dispatch: table ip kube-proxy { # The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet. map service-ips { type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict comment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\" elements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80, 172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443, 172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80, ... } } # Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an # element in the map. (This rule says, \"construct a tuple from the # destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look # that tuple up in \"service-ips\"; and if there's a match, execute the # associated verdict.) chain services { ip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips } ... } Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly O(1) map lookup, packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar: But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000 Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000 Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few microseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to squint to see the nftables results!: Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are great, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size: the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when Services and their endpoints change. With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a whole (actual rules, plus associated data) is O(n) in the combined number of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables backend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of thousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of iptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving kube-proxy so that it could skip updating most of the unchanged rules in each update, but the limitations of iptables-restore as an API meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's O(n) in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller constant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can still be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's minSyncPeriod config option to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to push iptables updates. The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and when kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the update is only O(n) in the number of Services and endpoints that have changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of Services and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each nftables-using component to have its own private table also means that there is no global lock contention between components like with iptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much more efficiently than with iptables. (Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.) Why not nftables? All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump right into using the nftables backend for now. First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit tests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in the real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as much real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise that it is as stable and bug-free. Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions; currently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of bugs in early versions of the nft command line tool, you should not run kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier than 1.0.0) version of nft in the host filesystem (or else kube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables on the system). Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such as the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet support kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the documentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components to see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they will not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or override kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether kube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability and monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data for kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in iptables mode. Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100% compatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old kube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less performant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that changing the default would be a compatibility break. Since the nftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad defaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In particular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only reachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable on all IPs, including 127.0.0.1, with iptables mode.) The kube-proxy documentation has more information about this, including information about metrics you can look at to determine if you are relying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration options are available to get more backward-compatible behavior. Trying out nftables mode Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to pass --proxy-mode nftables to kube-proxy (or set mode: nftables in your kube-proxy config file). If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm documentation explains how to pass a KubeProxyConfiguration to kubeadm init. You can also deploy nftables-based clusters with kind. You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to nftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the kube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting in nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs rules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs mode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.) Future plans As mentioned above, while nftables is now the best kube-proxy mode, it is not the default, and we do not yet have a plan for changing that. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time. The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main advantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of the IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes (for example, the fact that the kube-ipvs0 device needs to have every Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of Kubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement using IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have different endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a local or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same performance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of the downsides: (In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use various other IPVS functionality, like alternative \"schedulers\" for balancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful, because kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS schedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the proxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic more cleverly.) While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop the IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people who are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode instead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in nftables mode that you can't work around). Learn more \"KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend\" has the history of the new feature. \"How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables\", from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting kube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables. \"From Observability to Performance\", from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024.

As the number of Services increases, both the average and\nthe worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection\nincreases (with the difference between best-case, average, and\nworst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP\naddress appears earlier or later in the <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain).</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like\nthis is to have a <em>single</em> rule, using a &quot;verdict map&quot; to do the\ndispatch:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>table ip kube-proxy {\n# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.\nmap service-ips {\ntype ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict\ncomment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\"\nelements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,\n172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,\n172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,\n... }\n}\n# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an\n# element in the map.

Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>. You can also <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode\">deploy nftables-based clusters with\n<code>kind</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to\nnftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the\nkube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting\nin nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs\nrules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs\nmode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, while nftables is now the <em>best</em> kube-proxy mode,\nit is not the <em>default</em>, and we do not yet have a plan for changing\nthat. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.</p>\n<p>The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main\nadvantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of\nthe IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes\n(for example, the fact that the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> device needs to have\n<em>every</em> Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of\nKubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement\nusing IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have\ndifferent endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a\nlocal or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same\nperformance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of\nthe downsides:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy ipvs-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/ipvs-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use\nvarious other IPVS functionality, like alternative &quot;schedulers&quot; for\nbalancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,\nbecause kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS\nschedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the\nproxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic\nmore cleverly.)</p>\n<p>While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop\nthe IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people\nwho are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode\ninstead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in\nnftables mode that you can't work around).</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md\">KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend</a>&quot; has the\nhistory of the new feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yOGHb2HjslY?si=6O4PVJu7fGpReo1U\">How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables</a>&quot;,\nfrom KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting\nkube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uYo2O3jbJLk?si=py2AXzMJZ4PuhxNg\">From Observability to Performance</a>&quot;, from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon\nNorth America 2024.

Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>.

      "summary_original": "Kubernetes 1.31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems. Cloud controller manager (KEP-2392) API server network proxy (KEP-1281) kubelet credential provider plugins (KEP-2133) Storage migration to use CSI (KEP-625) The cloud controller manager is part of the control plane. It is a critical component that replaces some functionality that existed previously in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet. Components of Kubernetes One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller, which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes. As you can see in the following diagram, when the kubelet starts, it registers the Node object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information, like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the Node, Region and Instance type information. Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods, standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using hostNetwork (more on this below) Examples of the dependency problem As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might occur. These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource (e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it will schedule properly. Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint As noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding Node object will have a no schedule taint named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a Deployment or DaemonSet, may not be able to schedule. If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the control plane, then the resulting Node objects will all have the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state. Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI. The Kubernetes documentation describes the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint as follows: \"The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.\" One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently. This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints, leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state. Our Recommendations There is no one \u201ccorrect way\u201d to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance: For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing. Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure. Setting \u201chostNetwork\u201d to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider\u2019s instructions). Use a scalable resource type. Deployments and DaemonSets are useful for controlling the lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster. Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure\u2019s node manager controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane. Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation from non-privileged user workloads. It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade the cloud controller performance. Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the node is not yet available for health monitoring. For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example, in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology for these scenarios. Example This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please consult your cloud provider\u2019s documentation. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager name: cloud-controller-manager namespace: kube-system spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager strategy: type: Recreate template: metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager annotations: kubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure spec: containers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager - name: cloud-controller-manager command: - /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager - --leader-elect=true - -v=1 image: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 50Mi hostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane nodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\" affinity: podAntiAffinity: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\" labelSelector: matchLabels: app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager tolerations: - effect: NoSchedule key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master operator: Exists - effect: NoExecute key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable operator: Exists tolerationSeconds: 120 - effect: NoExecute key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready operator: Exists tolerationSeconds: 120 - effect: NoSchedule key: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized operator: Exists - effect: NoSchedule key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready operator: Exists When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.",

The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p>\n<p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-uninitialized-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding <code>Node</code> object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one \u201ccorrect way\u201d to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting \u201chostNetwork\u201d to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider\u2019s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure\u2019s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above.

Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-uninitialized-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding <code>Node</code> object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one \u201ccorrect way\u201d to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting \u201chostNetwork\u201d to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider\u2019s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure\u2019s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above.

      "summary": "Kirsten Garrison leads Google's Enhancements subproject in SIG Architecture. Kirsten Garrison is the lead of the Enhancements subproject within SIG Architecture at Google.",
      "summary_original": "This is the fourth interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture: Enhancements. In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject. The Enhancements subproject Frederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role. Kirsten Garrison (KG): I\u2019m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release team, eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in process) based on my team\u2019s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and contributing to the Subproject\u2019s work. FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of intervention? KG: The Enhancements Subproject primarily concerns itself with the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP for short)\u2014the \"design\" documents required for all features and significant changes to the Kubernetes project. The KEP and its impact FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren\u2019t aware of it? KG: Every release, the SIGs let the Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move through 3 phases: alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG. The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP template has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review team and the Production Readiness Review team1 before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base. FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most significant improvements of that approach? KG: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP process is communication and consideration. To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process in place over time. As Kubernetes matures, we\u2019ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user expectations. And as we\u2019ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements (varying at different stages of a KEP\u2019s lifecycle). Current areas of focus FSM: Speaking of maturing, we\u2019ve recently released Kubernetes v1.31, and work on v1.32 has started. Are there any areas that the Enhancements sub-project is currently addressing that might change the way things are done? KG: We\u2019re currently working on two things: Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so will only encourage more discussion and transparency. KEP versioning. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning. Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large. FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was this a particular area of focus for the subproject? KG: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team\u2019s Enhancement team in the migration away from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads \"opt-in\" KEPs for release tracking. This helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards. FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow... KG: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it\u2019s important to give careful consideration to decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in the KEP process! Getting involved FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the required skills for participating in the sub-project? KG: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take it from there. FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to share with our readers? KG: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it successful.

      "summary": "-",
      "summary_original": "Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory consumption. Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers. Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests? Our investigation revealed that this substantial memory allocation occurs because the server before sending the first byte to the client must: fetch data from the database, deserialize the data from its stored format, and finally construct the final response by converting and serializing the data into a client requested format This sequence results in significant temporary memory consumption. The actual usage depends on many factors like the page size, applied filters (e.g. label selectors), query parameters, and sizes of individual objects. Unfortunately, neither API Priority and Fairness nor Golang's garbage collection or Golang memory limits can prevent the system from exhausting memory under these conditions. The memory is allocated suddenly and rapidly, and just a few requests can quickly deplete the available memory, leading to resource exhaustion. Depending on how the API server is run on the node, it might either be killed through OOM by the kernel when exceeding the configured memory limits during these uncontrolled spikes, or if limits are not configured it might have even worse impact on the control plane node. And worst, after the first API server failure, the same requests will likely hit another control plane node in an HA setup with probably the same impact. Potentially a situation that is hard to diagnose and hard to recover from. Streaming list requests Today, we're excited to announce a major improvement. With the graduation of the watch list feature to beta in Kubernetes 1.32, client-go users can opt-in (after explicitly enabling WatchListClient feature gate) to streaming lists by switching from list to (a special kind of) watch requests. Watch requests are served from the watch cache, an in-memory cache designed to improve scalability of read operations. By streaming each item individually instead of returning the entire collection, the new method maintains constant memory overhead. The API server is bound by the maximum allowed size of an object in etcd plus a few additional allocations. This approach drastically reduces the temporary memory usage compared to traditional list requests, ensuring a more efficient and stable system, especially in clusters with a large number of objects of a given type or large average object sizes where despite paging memory consumption used to be high. Building on the insight gained from the synthetic test (see the synthetic test, we developed an automated performance test to systematically evaluate the impact of the watch list feature. This test replicates the same scenario, generating a large number of Secrets with a large payload, and scaling the number of informers to simulate heavy list request patterns. The automated test is executed periodically to monitor memory usage of the server with the feature enabled and disabled. The results showed significant improvements with the watch list feature enabled. With the feature turned on, the kube-apiserver\u2019s memory consumption stabilized at approximately 2 GB. By contrast, with the feature disabled, memory usage increased to approximately 20GB, a 10x increase! These results confirm the effectiveness of the new streaming API, which reduces the temporary memory footprint. Enabling API Streaming for your component Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32. Make sure your cluster uses etcd in version 3.4.31+ or 3.5.13+. Change your client software to use watch lists. If your client code is written in Golang, you'll want to enable WatchListClient for client-go. For details on enabling that feature, read Introducing Feature Gates to Client-Go: Enhancing Flexibility and Control. What's next? In Kubernetes 1.32, the feature is enabled in kube-controller-manager by default despite its beta state. This will eventually be expanded to other core components like kube-scheduler or kubelet; once the feature becomes generally available, if not earlier. Other 3rd-party components are encouraged to opt-in to the feature during the beta phase, especially when they are at risk of accessing a large number of resources or kinds with potentially large object sizes. For the time being, API Priority and Fairness assigns a reasonable small cost to list requests. This is necessary to allow enough parallelism for the average case where list requests are cheap enough. But it does not match the spiky exceptional situation of many and large objects. Once the majority of the Kubernetes ecosystem has switched to watch list, the list cost estimation can be changed to larger values without risking degraded performance in the average case, and with that increasing the protection against this kind of requests that can still hit the API server in the future. The synthetic test In order to reproduce the issue, we conducted a manual test to understand the impact of list requests on kube-apiserver memory usage. In the test, we created 400 Secrets, each containing 1 MB of data, and used informers to retrieve all Secrets. The results were alarming, only 16 informers were needed to cause the test server to run out of memory and crash, demonstrating how quickly memory consumption can grow under such conditions. Special shout out to @deads2k for his help in shaping this feature. Kubernetes 1.33 update Since this feature was started, Marek Siarkowicz integrated a new technology into the Kubernetes API server: streaming collection encoding. Kubernetes v1.33 introduced two related feature gates, StreamingCollectionEncodingToJSON and StreamingCollectionEncodingToProtobuf. These features encode via a stream and avoid allocating all the memory at once. This functionality is bit-for-bit compatible with existing list encodings, produces even greater server-side memory savings, and doesn't require any changes to client code. In 1.33, the WatchList feature gate is disabled by default.",

      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster. Understanding the feature The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page. If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the reservedSystemCPUs option. However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only compares the CPU requests against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than the requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up the capacity of reservedSystemCPUs, which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we know that people saw this in real life deployments. The existing behavior also made benchmarking (for both infrastructure and workloads) results inaccurate. When this new strict-cpu-reservation policy option is enabled, the CPU Manager static policy will not allow any workload to use the reserved system CPU cores. Enabling the feature To enable this feature, you need to turn on both the CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions feature gate and the strict-cpu-reservation policy option. And you need to remove the /var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state file if it exists and restart kubelet. With the following kubelet configuration: kind: KubeletConfiguration apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 featureGates: ... CPUManagerPolicyOptions: true CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions: true cpuManagerPolicy: static cpuManagerPolicyOptions: strict-cpu-reservation: \"true\" reservedSystemCPUs: \"0,32,1,33,16,48\" ... When strict-cpu-reservation is not set or set to false: # cat /var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state {\"policyName\":\"static\",\"defaultCpuSet\":\"0-63\",\"checksum\":1058907510} When strict-cpu-reservation is set to true: # cat /var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state {\"policyName\":\"static\",\"defaultCpuSet\":\"2-15,17-31,34-47,49-63\",\"checksum\":4141502832} Monitoring the feature You can monitor the feature impact by checking the following CPU Manager counters: cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores: report shared pool size, in millicores (e.g. 13500m) cpu_manager_exclusive_cpu_allocation_count: report exclusively allocated cores, counting full cores (e.g. 16) Your best-effort workloads may starve if the cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores count is zero for prolonged time. We believe any pod that is required for operational purpose like a log forwarder should not run as best-effort, but you can review and adjust the amount of CPU cores reserved as needed. Conclusion Strict CPU reservation is critical for Telco/NFV use cases. It is also a prerequisite for enabling the all-in-one type of deployments where workloads are placed on nodes serving combined control+worker+storage roles. We want you to start using the feature and looking forward to your feedback. Further reading Please check out the Control CPU Management Policies on the Node task page to learn more about the CPU Manager, and how it fits in relation to the other node-level resource managers. Getting involved This feature is driven by the SIG Node. If you are interested in helping develop this feature, sharing feedback, or participating in any other ongoing SIG Node projects, please attend the SIG Node meeting for more details.",

      "summary_original": "With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet's workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog. Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging. Observability improvements As part of the effort to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns. memory_manager_pinning_requests_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages. memory_manager_pinning_errors_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed. Improving memory manager reliability and consistency The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering when admitting pods after a restart or reboot. In certain edge cases, this behavior could cause the memory manager to reject some pods, and in more extreme cases, it may cause kubelet to fail upon restart. Previously, the beta implementation lacked certain checks and logic to prevent these issues. To stabilize the memory manager for general availability (GA) readiness, small but critical refinements have been made to the algorithm, improving its robustness and handling of edge cases. Future development There is more to come for the future of Topology Manager in general, and memory manager in particular. Notably, ongoing efforts are underway to extend memory manager support to Windows, enabling CPU and memory affinity on a Windows operating system.

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/",
      "summary": "Kubernetes v1.",
      "summary_original": "The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods one by one. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes. Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named QueueingHint. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput. Scheduling queue The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the scheduling queue. The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures: ActiveQ: holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling. BackoffQ: holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The backoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod. Unschedulable Pod Pool: holds Pods that the scheduler won't attempt to schedule for one of the following reasons: The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster hasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable. The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins, for example, they have a scheduling gate, and get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin. Scheduling framework and plugins The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes scheduling framework. And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins (e.g., Pod affinity is implemented in the InterPodAffinity plugin.) The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called cycles as follows: Scheduling cycle: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling queue one by one. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The scheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time. If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool component of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node, the Pod goes to the binding cycle. Binding cycle: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API server. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node. Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling cycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those Pods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods. Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling queue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes. Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called cluster events), with EnqueueExtensions (EventsToRegister), and the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle. Additionally, we had an internal feature called preCheck, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints; For example, preCheck could filter out node-related events when the node status is NotReady. However, we had two issues for those approaches: Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason. A new scheduled Pod might solve the InterPodAffinity's failure, but not all of them do. For example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching InterPodAffinity of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable. preCheck relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins, like in issue #110175. Here QueueingHints come into play; a QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable. For example, consider a Pod named pod-a that has a required Pod affinity. pod-a was rejected in the scheduling cycle by the InterPodAffinity plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched the Pod affinity specification for pod-a. A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin pod-a moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool. The scheduling queue records which plugin caused the scheduling failure for the Pod. For pod-a, the scheduling queue records that the InterPodAffinity plugin rejected the Pod. pod-a will never be schedulable until the InterPodAffinity failure is resolved. There're some scenarios that the failure could be resolved, one example is an existing running pod gets a label update and becomes matching a Pod affinity. For this scenario, the InterPodAffinity plugin's QueuingHint callback function checks every Pod label update that occurs in the cluster. Then, if a Pod gets a label update that matches the Pod affinity requirement of pod-a, the InterPodAffinity, plugin's QueuingHint prompts the scheduling queue to move pod-a back into the ActiveQ or the BackoffQ component. A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a being moved by InterPodAffinity QueueingHint QueueingHint's history and what's new in v1.32 At SIG Scheduling, we have been working on the development of QueueingHint since Kubernetes v1.28. While QueuingHint isn't user-facing, we implemented the SchedulerQueueingHints feature gate as a safety measure when we originally added this feature. In v1.28, we implemented QueueingHints with a few in-tree plugins experimentally, and made the feature gate enabled by default. However, users reported a memory leak, and consequently we disabled the feature gate in a patch release of v1.28. From v1.28 until v1.31, we kept working on the QueueingHint implementation within the rest of the in-tree plugins and fixing bugs. In v1.32, we made this feature enabled by default again. We finished implementing QueueingHints in all plugins and also identified the cause of the memory leak! We thank all the contributors who participated in the development of this feature and those who reported and investigated the earlier issues. Getting involved These features are managed by Kubernetes SIG Scheduling. Please join us and share your feedback. How can I learn more?

          "summary_text": "<p>The Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/\">scheduler</a> is the core\ncomponent that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes\nthese new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important\nthe throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput\nof the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the\nscheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#extension-points\">scheduling context element</a>\nnamed <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how\nQueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-queue\">Scheduling queue</h2>\n<p>The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the <em>scheduling queue</em>.</p>\n<p>The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ActiveQ</strong>: holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling.</li>\n<li><strong>BackoffQ</strong>: holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The\nbackoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod.</li>\n<li><strong>Unschedulable Pod Pool</strong>: holds Pods that the scheduler won't attempt to schedule for one of the\nfollowing reasons:\n<ul>\n<li>The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster\nhasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</li>\n<li>The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins,\nfor example, they have a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/#configuring-pod-schedulinggates\">scheduling gate</a>,\nand get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-framework-and-plugins\">Scheduling framework and plugins</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/\">scheduling framework</a>.</p>\n<p>And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins\n(e.g., <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\">Pod affinity</a>\nis implemented in the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin.)</p>\n<p>The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called <em>cycles</em> as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scheduling cycle</strong>: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling\nqueue <em>one by one</em>. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The\nscheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time.</p>\n<p>If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool\ncomponent of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node,\nthe Pod goes to the binding cycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Binding cycle</strong>: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API\nserver. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling\ncycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those\nPods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improvements-to-retrying-pod-scheduling-with-queuinghint\">Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint</h2>\n<p>Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling\nqueue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes.</p>\n<p>Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called <em>cluster events</em>),\nwith <code>EnqueueExtensions</code> (<code>EventsToRegister</code>),\nand the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had an internal feature called <code>preCheck</code>, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints;\nFor example, <code>preCheck</code> could filter out node-related events when the node status is <code>NotReady</code>.</p>\n<p>However, we had two issues for those approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason.\n<ul>\n<li>A new scheduled Pod <em>might</em> solve the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>'s failure, but not all of them do.\nFor example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching <code>InterPodAffinity</code> of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>preCheck</code> relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins,\nlike in issue <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175\">#110175</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here QueueingHints come into play;\na QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a Pod named <code>pod-a</code> that has a required Pod affinity. <code>pod-a</code> was rejected in\nthe scheduling cycle by the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched\nthe Pod affinity specification for <code>pod-a</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/queueinghint1.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><code>pod-a</code> moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool.

      "summary": "The Kubernetes SIG Network announces Gateway API v1.",
      "summary_original": "Kubernetes SIG Network is delighted to announce the general availability of Gateway API v1.2! This version of the API was released on October 3, and we're delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out. Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the Standard channel (Gateway API's GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process \u2014 but it also brings two breaking changes that you'll want to be careful of. Breaking changes GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant v1alpha2 removal Now that the v1 versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to Standard, the old v1alpha2 versions have been removed from both the Standard and Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that perpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API community. Before upgrading to Gateway API v1.2, you'll want to confirm that any implementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API version of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even if you've been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be using v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally, Kubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version that it thinks you're using: check out the release notes for more information about what you need to do to safely upgrade. Change to .status.supportedFeatures (experimental) A much smaller breaking change: .status.supportedFeatures in a Gateway is now a list of objects instead of a list of strings. The objects have a single name field, so the translation from the strings is straightforward, but moving to objects permits a lot more flexibility for the future. This stanza is not yet present in the Standard channel. Graduations to the standard channel Gateway API 1.2.0 graduates four features to the Standard channel, meaning that they can now be considered generally available. Inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we certainly expect further refinements and improvements to these new features in the future. For more information on how all of this works, refer to the Gateway API Versioning Policy. HTTPRoute timeouts GEP-1742 introduced the timeouts stanza into HTTPRoute, permitting configuring basic timeouts for HTTP traffic. This is a simple but important feature for proper resilience when handling HTTP traffic, and it is now Standard. For example, this HTTPRoute configuration sets a timeout of 300ms for traffic to the /face path: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: face-with-timeouts namespace: faces spec: parentRefs: - name: my-gateway kind: Gateway rules: - matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: /face backendRefs: - name: face port: 80 timeouts: request: 300ms For more information, check out the HTTP routing documentation. (Note that this applies only to HTTPRoute timeouts. GRPCRoute timeouts are not yet part of Gateway API.) Gateway infrastructure labels and annotations Gateway API implementations are responsible for creating the backing infrastructure needed to make each Gateway work. For example, implementations running in a Kubernetes cluster often create Services and Deployments, while cloud-based implementations may be creating cloud load balancer resources. In many cases, it can be helpful to be able to propagate labels or annotations to these generated resources. In v1.2.0, the Gateway infrastructure stanza moves to the Standard channel, allowing you to specify labels and annotations for the infrastructure created by the Gateway API controller. For example, if your Gateway infrastructure is running in-cluster, you can specify both Linkerd and Istio injection using the following Gateway configuration, making it simpler for the infrastructure to be incorporated into whichever service mesh you've installed: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Gateway metadata: name: meshed-gateway namespace: incoming spec: gatewayClassName: meshed-gateway-class listeners: - name: http-listener protocol: HTTP port: 80 infrastructure: labels: istio-injection: enabled annotations: linkerd.io/inject: enabled For more information, check out the infrastructure API reference. Backend protocol support Since Kubernetes v1.20, the Service and EndpointSlice resources have supported a stable appProtocol field to allow users to specify the L7 protocol that Service supports. With the adoption of KEP 3726, Kubernetes now supports three new appProtocol values: kubernetes.io/h2c HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in RFC7540 kubernetes.io/ws WebSocket over cleartext as described in RFC6445 kubernetes.io/wss WebSocket over TLS as described in RFC6445 With Gateway API 1.2.0, support for honoring appProtocol is now Standard. For example, given the following Service: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: websocket-service namespace: my-namespace spec: selector: app.kubernetes.io/name: websocket-app ports: - name: http port: 80 targetPort: 9376 protocol: TCP appProtocol: kubernetes.io/ws then an HTTPRoute that includes this Service as a backendRef will automatically upgrade the connection to use WebSockets rather than assuming that the connection is pure HTTP. For more information, check out GEP-1911. New additions to experimental channel Named rules for *Route resources The rules field in HTTPRoute and GRPCRoute resources can now be named, in order to make it easier to reference the specific rule, for example: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: multi-color-route namespace: faces spec: parentRefs: - name: my-gateway kind: Gateway port: 80 rules: - name: center-rule matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: /color/center backendRefs: - name: color-center port: 80 - name: edge-rule matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: /color/edge backendRefs: - name: color-edge port: 80 Logging or status messages can now refer to these two rules as center-rule or edge-rule instead of being forced to refer to them by index. For more information, see GEP-995. HTTPRoute retry support Gateway API 1.2.0 introduces experimental support for counted HTTPRoute retries. For example, the following HTTPRoute configuration retries requests to the /face path up to 3 times with a 500ms delay between retries: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: face-with-retries namespace: faces spec: parentRefs: - name: my-gateway kind: Gateway port: 80 rules: - matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: /face backendRefs: - name: face port: 80 retry: codes: [ 500, 502, 503, 504 ] attempts: 3 backoff: 500ms For more information, check out GEP 1731. HTTPRoute percentage-based mirroring Gateway API has long supported the Request Mirroring feature, which allows sending the same request to multiple backends. In Gateway API 1.2.0, we're introducing percentage-based mirroring, which allows you to specify a percentage of requests to mirror to a different backend. For example, the following HTTPRoute configuration mirrors 42% of requests to the color-mirror backend: apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: color-mirror-route namespace: faces spec: parentRefs: - name: mirror-gateway hostnames: - mirror.example rules: - backendRefs: - name: color port: 80 filters: - type: RequestMirror requestMirror: backendRef: name: color-mirror port: 80 percent: 42 # This value must be an integer. There's also a fraction stanza which can be used in place of percent, to allow for more precise control over exactly what amount of traffic is mirrored, for example: ... filters: - type: RequestMirror requestMirror: backendRef: name: color-mirror port: 80 fraction: numerator: 1 denominator: 10000 This configuration mirrors 1 in 10,000 requests to the color-mirror backend, which may be relevant with very high request rates. For more details, see GEP-1731. Additional backend TLS configuration This release includes three additions related to TLS configuration for communications between a Gateway and a workload (a backend): A new backendTLS field on Gateway This new field allows you to specify the client certificate that a Gateway should use when connecting to backends. A new subjectAltNames field on BackendTLSPolicy Previously, the hostname field was used to configure both the SNI that a Gateway should send to a backend and the identity that should be provided by a certificate. When the new subjectAltNames field is specified, any certificate matching at least one of the specified SANs will be considered valid. This is particularly critical for SPIFFE where URI-based SANs may not be valid SNIs. A new options field on BackendTLSPolicy Similar to the TLS options field on Gateway Listeners, we believe the same concept will be broadly useful for TLS-specific configuration for Backend TLS. For more information, check out GEP-3135. More changes For a full list of the changes included in this release, please refer to the v1.2.0 release notes. Project updates Beyond the technical, the v1.2 release also marks a few milestones in the life of the Gateway API project itself. Release process improvements Gateway API has never been intended to be a static API, and as more projects use it as a component to build on, it's become clear that we need to bring some more predictability to Gateway API releases. To that end, we're pleased - and a little nervous! - to announce that we've formalized a new release process: Scoping (4-6 weeks): maintainers and community determine the set of features we want to include in the release. A particular emphasis here is getting features out of the Experimental channel \u2014 ideally this involves moving them to Standard, but it can also mean removing them. GEP Iteration and Review (5-7 weeks): contributors write or update Gateway Enhancement Proposals (GEPs) for features accepted into the release, with emphasis on getting consensus around the design and graduation criteria of the feature. API Refinement and Documentation (3-5 weeks): contributors implement the features in the Gateway API controllers and write the necessary documentation. SIG Network Review and Release Candidates (2-4 weeks): maintainers get the required upstream review, build release candidates, and release the new version. Gateway API 1.2.0 was the first release to use the new process, and although there are the usual rough edges of anything new, we believe that it went well. We've already completed the Scoping phase for Gateway API 1.3, with the release expected around the end of January 2025. gwctl moves out The gwctl CLI tool has moved into its very own repository, https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl. gwctl has proven a valuable tool for the Gateway API community; moving it into its own repository will, we believe, make it easier to maintain and develop. As always, we welcome contributions; while still experimental, gwctl already helps make working with Gateway API a bit easier \u2014 especially for newcomers to the project! Maintainer changes Rounding out our changes to the project itself, we're pleased to announce that Mattia Lavacca has joined the ranks of Gateway API Maintainers! We're also sad to announce that Keith Mattix has stepped down as a GAMMA lead \u2014 happily, Mike Morris has returned to the role. We're grateful for everything Keith has done, and excited to have Mattia and Mike on board. Try it out Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running Kubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this version of Gateway API. To try out the API, follow our Getting Started Guide. As of this writing, five implementations are already conformant with Gateway API v1.2. In alphabetical order: Cilium v1.17.0-pre.1, Experimental channel Envoy Gateway v1.2.0-rc.1, Experimental channel Istio v1.24.0-alpha.0, Experimental channel Kong v3.2.0-244-gea4944bb0, Experimental channel Traefik v3.2, Experimental channel Get involved There are lots of opportunities to get involved and help define the future of Kubernetes routing APIs for both ingress and service mesh. Check out the user guides to see what use-cases can be addressed. Try out one of the existing Gateway controllers. Or join us in the community and help us build the future of Gateway API together! The maintainers would like to thank everyone who's contributed to Gateway API, whether in the form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general support. We could never have gotten this far without the support of this dedicated and active community.

Additionally,\nKubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version\nthat it thinks you're using: check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0\">release notes</a> for more\ninformation about what you need to do to safely upgrade.</p>\n<h3 id=\"status-supported-features\">Change to <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> (experimental)</h3>\n<p>A much smaller breaking change: <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> in a Gateway is\nnow a list of objects instead of a list of strings. The objects have a single\n<code>name</code> field, so the translation from the strings is straightforward, but\nmoving to objects permits a lot more flexibility for the future. This stanza\nis not yet present in the Standard channel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-to-the-standard-channel\">Graduations to the standard channel</h2>\n<p>Gateway API 1.2.0 graduates four features to the Standard channel, meaning\nthat they can now be considered generally available. Inclusion in the Standard\nrelease channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and\nprovides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other\nKubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with\nbackward-compatible additions over time, and we certainly expect further\nrefinements and improvements to these new features in the future. For more\ninformation on how all of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning\nPolicy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"httproute-timeouts\">HTTPRoute timeouts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1742/\">GEP-1742</a> introduced the\n<code>timeouts</code> stanza into HTTPRoute, permitting configuring basic timeouts for\nHTTP traffic. This is a simple but important feature for proper resilience\nwhen handling HTTP traffic, and it is now Standard.</p>\n<p>For example, this HTTPRoute configuration sets a timeout of 300ms for traffic\nto the <code>/face</code> path:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>HTTPRoute<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>face-with-timeouts<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>faces<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">parentRefs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>my-gateway<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Gateway<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">matches</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">path</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">type</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>PathPrefix<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">value</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>/face<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">backendRefs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>face<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">port</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">80</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">timeouts</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">request</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>300ms<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>For more information, check out the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-routing/\">HTTP routing</a> documentation.

GRPCRoute timeouts are not yet part\nof Gateway API.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"gateway-infrastructure-labels-and-annotations\">Gateway infrastructure labels and annotations</h3>\n<p>Gateway API implementations are responsible for creating the backing\ninfrastructure needed to make each Gateway work. For example, implementations\nrunning in a Kubernetes cluster often create Services and Deployments, while\ncloud-based implementations may be creating cloud load balancer resources. In\nmany cases, it can be helpful to be able to propagate labels or annotations to\nthese generated resources.</p>\n<p>In v1.2.0, the Gateway <code>infrastructure</code> stanza moves to the Standard channel,\nallowing you to specify labels and annotations for the infrastructure created\nby the Gateway API controller. For example, if your Gateway infrastructure is\nrunning in-cluster, you can specify both Linkerd and Istio injection using the\nfollowing Gateway configuration, making it simpler for the infrastructure to\nbe incorporated into whichever service mesh you've installed:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\nname: meshed-gateway\nnamespace: incoming\nspec:\ngatewayClassName: meshed-gateway-class\nlisteners:\n- name: http-listener\nprotocol: HTTP\nport: 80\ninfrastructure:\nlabels:\nistio-injection: enabled\nannotations:\nlinkerd.io/inject: enabled\n</code></pre><p>For more information, check out the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.GatewayInfrastructure\"><code>infrastructure</code> API reference</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-protocol-support\">Backend protocol support</h3>\n<p>Since Kubernetes v1.20, the Service and EndpointSlice resources have supported\na stable <code>appProtocol</code> field to allow users to specify the L7 protocol that\nService supports. With the adoption of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/3726-standard-application-protocols\">KEP 3726</a>,\nKubernetes now supports three new <code>appProtocol</code> values:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>kubernetes.io/h2c</code></dt>\n<dd>HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540\">RFC7540</a></dd>\n<dt><code>kubernetes.io/ws</code></dt>\n<dd>WebSocket over cleartext as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6445\">RFC6445</a></dd>\n<dt><code>kubernetes.io/wss</code></dt>\n<dd>WebSocket over TLS as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6445\">RFC6445</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>With Gateway API 1.2.0, support for honoring <code>appProtocol</code> is now Standard.\nFor example, given the following Service:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

To that end, we're pleased -\nand a little nervous! - to announce that we've formalized a new release\nprocess:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scoping</strong> (4-6 weeks): maintainers and community determine the set of\nfeatures we want to include in the release. A particular emphasis here is\ngetting features <em>out</em> of the Experimental channel \u2014 ideally this involves\nmoving them to Standard, but it can also mean removing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GEP Iteration and Review</strong> (5-7 weeks): contributors write or update\nGateway Enhancement Proposals (GEPs) for features accepted into the release,\nwith emphasis on getting consensus around the design and graduation criteria\nof the feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API Refinement and Documentation</strong> (3-5 weeks): contributors implement the\nfeatures in the Gateway API controllers and write the necessary\ndocumentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SIG Network Review and Release Candidates</strong> (2-4 weeks): maintainers get\nthe required upstream review, build release candidates, and release the new\nversion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gateway API 1.2.0 was the first release to use the new process, and although\nthere are the usual rough edges of anything new, we believe that it went well.\nWe've already completed the Scoping phase for Gateway API 1.3, with the\nrelease expected around the end of January 2025.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gwctl-moves-out\"><code>gwctl</code> moves out</h3>\n<p>The <code>gwctl</code> CLI tool has moved into its very own repository,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl\">https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl</a>. <code>gwctl</code> has proven a valuable tool\nfor the Gateway API community; moving it into its own repository will, we\nbelieve, make it easier to maintain and develop. As always, we welcome\ncontributions; while still experimental, <code>gwctl</code> already helps make working\nwith Gateway API a bit easier \u2014 especially for newcomers to the project!</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintainer-changes\">Maintainer changes</h3>\n<p>Rounding out our changes to the project itself, we're pleased to announce that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mlavacca\">Mattia Lavacca</a> has joined the ranks of Gateway API Maintainers! We're also\nsad to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/keithmattix\">Keith Mattix</a> has stepped down as a GAMMA lead \u2014\nhappily, <a href=\"https://github.com/mikemorris\">Mike Morris</a> has returned to the role. We're grateful for everything\nKeith has done, and excited to have Mattia and Mike on board.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of\nKubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running\nKubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this\nversion of Gateway API.</p>\n<p>To try out the API, follow our <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">Getting Started\nGuide</a>.

This version of the API\nwas released on October 3, and we're delighted to report that we now have a\nnumber of conformant implementations of it for you to try out.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the <em>Standard channel</em>\n(Gateway API's GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features,\nand inaugurates our new release process \u2014 but it also brings two breaking\nchanges that you'll want to be careful of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"grpcroute-and-referencegrant-v1alpha2-removal\">GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant <code>v1alpha2</code> removal</h3>\n<p>Now that the <code>v1</code> versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to\nStandard, the old <code>v1alpha2</code> versions have been removed from both the Standard\nand Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that\nperpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>Before upgrading to Gateway API v1.2, you'll want to confirm that any\nimplementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API\nversion of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even\nif you've been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be\nusing v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally,\nKubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version\nthat it thinks you're using: check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0\">release notes</a> for more\ninformation about what you need to do to safely upgrade.</p>\n<h3 id=\"status-supported-features\">Change to <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> (experimental)</h3>\n<p>A much smaller breaking change: <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> in a Gateway is\nnow a list of objects instead of a list of strings. The objects have a single\n<code>name</code> field, so the translation from the strings is straightforward, but\nmoving to objects permits a lot more flexibility for the future. This stanza\nis not yet present in the Standard channel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-to-the-standard-channel\">Graduations to the standard channel</h2>\n<p>Gateway API 1.2.0 graduates four features to the Standard channel, meaning\nthat they can now be considered generally available. Inclusion in the Standard\nrelease channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and\nprovides guarantees of backward compatibility.

For example, implementations\nrunning in a Kubernetes cluster often create Services and Deployments, while\ncloud-based implementations may be creating cloud load balancer resources. In\nmany cases, it can be helpful to be able to propagate labels or annotations to\nthese generated resources.</p>\n<p>In v1.2.0, the Gateway <code>infrastructure</code> stanza moves to the Standard channel,\nallowing you to specify labels and annotations for the infrastructure created\nby the Gateway API controller. For example, if your Gateway infrastructure is\nrunning in-cluster, you can specify both Linkerd and Istio injection using the\nfollowing Gateway configuration, making it simpler for the infrastructure to\nbe incorporated into whichever service mesh you've installed:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\nname: meshed-gateway\nnamespace: incoming\nspec:\ngatewayClassName: meshed-gateway-class\nlisteners:\n- name: http-listener\nprotocol: HTTP\nport: 80\ninfrastructure:\nlabels:\nistio-injection: enabled\nannotations:\nlinkerd.io/inject: enabled\n</code></pre><p>For more information, check out the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.GatewayInfrastructure\"><code>infrastructure</code> API reference</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-protocol-support\">Backend protocol support</h3>\n<p>Since Kubernetes v1.20, the Service and EndpointSlice resources have supported\na stable <code>appProtocol</code> field to allow users to specify the L7 protocol that\nService supports.

When the new <code>subjectAltNames</code> field is specified, any\ncertificate matching at least one of the specified SANs will be considered\nvalid. This is particularly critical for SPIFFE where URI-based SANs may\nnot be valid SNIs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A new <code>options</code> field on BackendTLSPolicy</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the TLS options field on Gateway Listeners, we believe the same\nconcept will be broadly useful for TLS-specific configuration for Backend\nTLS.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, check out\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-3155\">GEP-3135</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-changes\">More changes</h2>\n<p>For a full list of the changes included in this release, please refer to the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0\">v1.2.0 release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-updates\">Project updates</h2>\n<p>Beyond the technical, the v1.2 release also marks a few milestones in the life\nof the Gateway API project itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"release-process-improvements\">Release process improvements</h3>\n<p>Gateway API has never been intended to be a static API, and as more projects\nuse it as a component to build on, it's become clear that we need to bring\nsome more predictability to Gateway API releases. To that end, we're pleased -\nand a little nervous! - to announce that we've formalized a new release\nprocess:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scoping</strong> (4-6 weeks): maintainers and community determine the set of\nfeatures we want to include in the release. A particular emphasis here is\ngetting features <em>out</em> of the Experimental channel \u2014 ideally this involves\nmoving them to Standard, but it can also mean removing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GEP Iteration and Review</strong> (5-7 weeks): contributors write or update\nGateway Enhancement Proposals (GEPs) for features accepted into the release,\nwith emphasis on getting consensus around the design and graduation criteria\nof the feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API Refinement and Documentation</strong> (3-5 weeks): contributors implement the\nfeatures in the Gateway API controllers and write the necessary\ndocumentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SIG Network Review and Release Candidates</strong> (2-4 weeks): maintainers get\nthe required upstream review, build release candidates, and release the new\nversion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gateway API 1.2.0 was the first release to use the new process, and although\nthere are the usual rough edges of anything new, we believe that it went well.\nWe've already completed the Scoping phase for Gateway API 1.3, with the\nrelease expected around the end of January 2025.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gwctl-moves-out\"><code>gwctl</code> moves out</h3>\n<p>The <code>gwctl</code> CLI tool has moved into its very own repository,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl\">https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl</a>. <code>gwctl</code> has proven a valuable tool\nfor the Gateway API community; moving it into its own repository will, we\nbelieve, make it easier to maintain and develop. As always, we welcome\ncontributions; while still experimental, <code>gwctl</code> already helps make working\nwith Gateway API a bit easier \u2014 especially for newcomers to the project!</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintainer-changes\">Maintainer changes</h3>\n<p>Rounding out our changes to the project itself, we're pleased to announce that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mlavacca\">Mattia Lavacca</a> has joined the ranks of Gateway API Maintainers! We're also\nsad to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/keithmattix\">Keith Mattix</a> has stepped down as a GAMMA lead \u2014\nhappily, <a href=\"https://github.com/mikemorris\">Mike Morris</a> has returned to the role. We're grateful for everything\nKeith has done, and excited to have Mattia and Mike on board.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of\nKubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running\nKubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this\nversion of Gateway API.</p>\n<p>To try out the API, follow our <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">Getting Started\nGuide</a>.

This version of the API\nwas released on October 3, and we're delighted to report that we now have a\nnumber of conformant implementations of it for you to try out.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the <em>Standard channel</em>\n(Gateway API's GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features,\nand inaugurates our new release process \u2014 but it also brings two breaking\nchanges that you'll want to be careful of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"grpcroute-and-referencegrant-v1alpha2-removal\">GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant <code>v1alpha2</code> removal</h3>\n<p>Now that the <code>v1</code> versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to\nStandard, the old <code>v1alpha2</code> versions have been removed from both the Standard\nand Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that\nperpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>Before upgrading to Gateway API v1.2, you'll want to confirm that any\nimplementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API\nversion of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even\nif you've been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be\nusing v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally,\nKubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version\nthat it thinks you're using: check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0\">release notes</a> for more\ninformation about what you need to do to safely upgrade.</p>\n<h3 id=\"status-supported-features\">Change to <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> (experimental)</h3>\n<p>A much smaller breaking change: <code>.status.supportedFeatures</code> in a Gateway is\nnow a list of objects instead of a list of strings. The objects have a single\n<code>name</code> field, so the translation from the strings is straightforward, but\nmoving to objects permits a lot more flexibility for the future. This stanza\nis not yet present in the Standard channel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-to-the-standard-channel\">Graduations to the standard channel</h2>\n<p>Gateway API 1.2.0 graduates four features to the Standard channel, meaning\nthat they can now be considered generally available. Inclusion in the Standard\nrelease channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and\nprovides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other\nKubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with\nbackward-compatible additions over time, and we certainly expect further\nrefinements and improvements to these new features in the future. For more\ninformation on how all of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning\nPolicy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"httproute-timeouts\">HTTPRoute timeouts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1742/\">GEP-1742</a> introduced the\n<code>timeouts</code> stanza into HTTPRoute, permitting configuring basic timeouts for\nHTTP traffic.

For example, implementations\nrunning in a Kubernetes cluster often create Services and Deployments, while\ncloud-based implementations may be creating cloud load balancer resources.

      "summary_original": "Hi there! I'm Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack. Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators. However, this is not the only way to extend the Kubernetes API. For more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic, managing subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API aggregation layer provides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom extension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework. In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited to address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement our own extension API server in Cozystack. What Is the API Aggregation Layer? First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road. The API aggregation layer is a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an API server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types. So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes, and directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API is registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge that it serves certain APIs. You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices: kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io Example APIService: NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server, which can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it. When to use the API Aggregation Layer The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might not enough. Let's break them down. Imperative Logic and Subresources Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources. In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources (like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage specific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object. A simple example is status, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can access independently from the parent object. The status field isn't meant to be changed But beyond /status, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like /exec, /portforward, and /log. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent endpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in a running container, and so on. To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an extension API server. Here are some well-known examples: KubeVirt: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines. The extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources like /restart, /console, and /vnc for virtual machines. Knative: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing, implementing the /scale subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types. By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be imperative, you can manage access to them declaratively using Kubernetes standard RBAC model. For example this way you can control access to the /log and /exec subresources of the Pod kind: kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: namespace: default name: pod-and-pod-logs-reader rules: - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"pods\", \"pods/log\"] verbs: [\"get\", \"list\"] - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"pods/exec\"] verbs: [\"create\"] You're not tied to use etcd Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses etcd for its backend. However, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd. If it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any other system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate: metrics-server is a standard extension for Kubernetes which allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node kinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics directly from Kubelet. So when you run kubectl top node or kubectl top pod, metrics-server fetches metrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information is generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need to store it in etcd. This approach saves resources. If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API for it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities in the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular Kubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using kubectl or any other Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources and reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind. This means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend. One-Time resources Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions. This is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these resources is that you can't view them using get or list verbs. You can only create them (using the create verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that moment. If you try to run kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews directly, you'll just get an error like this: Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this type of resource (you can only CREATE them). The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as: kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev When you run the command above, kubectl creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the Kubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user. Kubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is different from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd. Similarly, in KubeVirt's CDI (Containerized Data Importer) extension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the virtctl tool, a special token is required before the upload process begins. This token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes routes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server, which generates and returns the token in response. Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create in your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks. While CRDs also support server-side validation using Common Expression Language (CEL) for declarative validation and ValidatingAdmissionPolicies without the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed. Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally v1alpha1, v1beta1 and v1. Only one version can be specified as the storage version. All requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version. With CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server, you can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one object might be serialized as v1, another as v2), or rely on an external backing API. Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow the additionalPrinterColumns logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that formats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using additionalPrinterColumns, you can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate and insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish. Dynamic resource registration The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs. Once your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover APIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically registers all available types for this API group. Although this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers the resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster. When not to use the API Aggregation Layer There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended. Let's go through them. Unstable backend If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it may block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait for a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources. If the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked. Also, you might have encountered a situation where, when the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request (even unrelated to metrics) stating that metrics.k8s.io is unavailable. This is another example of how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests is unavailable. Slow requests If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a CustomResourceDefinition and controller. Otherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension API server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources. This recommendation is also mentioned in the official Kubernetes documentation. Why we needed it in Cozystack As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform Cozystack, which can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability to easily extend the platform is crucial for us. Cozystack is built on top of FluxCD. Any application is packaged into its own Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform is done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application. All the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new applications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged into the appropriate Helm chart. Interface of the Cozystack platform So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into two problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these Limitations of the RBAC model The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources of the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit access across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in resourceNames. For verbs like get or update it will work. However, filtering by resourceNames using list verb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name. Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions. This is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these resources is that you can't view them using get or list verbs. You can only create them (using the create verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that moment. So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and generate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server. This way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types. Need for a public API Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize public access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources like HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to deploy, potentially compromising our system. We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding kind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from which it's deployed. Here are some examples: kind: Kubernetes \u2192 chart: kubernetes kind: Postgres \u2192 chart: postgres kind: Redis \u2192 chart: redis kind: VirtualMachine \u2192 chart: virtual-machine Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server every time we add a new chart for it to start being served. The schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator. Two-Way conversion Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources. At this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply translating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways. If you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a custom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease. We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources. All requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa. This eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic. Implementation To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects: apiserver-builder: Currently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder, providing a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create a project structure and generate code for your resources. sample-apiserver: A ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries, which you can use as a foundation for your project. For practical reasons, we chose the second project. Here's what we needed to do: Disable etcd support In our case, we don't need it since all resources are stored directly in the Kubernetes API. You can disable etcd options by passing nil to RecommendedOptions.Etcd: Disabling etcd options Generate a common resource kind We called it Application, and it looks like this: Application type definition This is a generic type used for any application type, and its handling logic is the same for all charts. Configure configuration loading Since we want to configure our extension api-server via a config file, we formed the config structure in Go: Config type definition We also modified the resource registration logic so that the resources we create are registered in scheme with different Kind values: Dynamic resource registration As a result, we got a config where you can pass all possible types and specify what they should map to: ConfigMap example Implement our own registry To store state not in etcd but translate it directly into Kubernetes HelmRelease resources (and vice versa), we wrote conversion functions from Application to HelmRelease and from HelmRelease to Application: Conversion functions We implemented logic to filter resources by chart name, sourceRef, and prefix in the HelmRelease name: Filtering functions Then, using this logic, we implemented the methods Get(), Delete(), List(), Create(). You can see the full example here: Registry Implementation At the end of each method, we set the correct Kind and return an unstructured.Unstructured{} object so that Kubernetes serializes the object correctly. Otherwise, it would always serialize them with kind: Application, which we don't want. What did we achieve? In Cozystack, all our types from the ConfigMap are now available in Kubernetes as-is: kubectl api-resources | grep cozystack buckets apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Bucket clickhouses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true ClickHouse etcds apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Etcd ferretdb apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true FerretDB httpcaches apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true HTTPCache ingresses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Ingress kafkas apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Kafka kuberneteses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Kubernetes monitorings apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Monitoring mysqls apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true MySQL natses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true NATS postgreses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Postgres rabbitmqs apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true RabbitMQ redises apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Redis seaweedfses apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true SeaweedFS tcpbalancers apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true TCPBalancer tenants apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true Tenant virtualmachines apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true VirtualMachine vmdisks apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true VMDisk vminstances apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true VMInstance vpns apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 true VPN We can work with them just like regular Kubernetes resources.

In the future, we plan to add new features: Add validation based on an OpenAPI spec generated directly from Helm charts. Develop a controller that collects release notes from deployed releases and shows users access information for specific services. Revamp our dashboard to work directly with the new API. Conclusion The API Aggregation Layer allowed us to quickly and efficiently solve our problem by providing a flexible mechanism for extending the Kubernetes API with dynamically registered resources and converting them on the fly. Ultimately, this made our platform even more flexible and extensible without the need to write code for each new resource. You can test the API yourself in the open-source PaaS platform Cozystack, starting from version v0.18.",
      "summary_html": "<p>Hi there! I'm Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as <a href=\"https://github.com/kvaps\">@kvaps</a> in communities dedicated to Kubernetes\nand cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder,\nproviding a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create\na project structure and generate code for your resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver\">sample-apiserver</a>:\nA ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries,\nwhich you can use as a foundation for your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For practical reasons, we chose the second project. Here's what we needed to do:</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-etcd-support\">Disable etcd support</h3>\n<p>In our case, we don't need it since all resources are stored directly in the Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>You can disable etcd options by passing nil to <code>RecommendedOptions.Etcd</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/cmd/server/start.go#L70\">Disabling etcd options</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"generate-a-common-resource-kind\">Generate a common resource kind</h3>\n<p>We called it Application, and it looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/types.go\">Application type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a generic type used for any application type, and its handling logic is the same for all charts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-configuration-loading\">Configure configuration loading</h3>\n<p>Since we want to configure our extension api-server via a config file, we formed the config structure in Go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/config/config.go\">Config type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also modified the resource registration logic so that the resources we create are registered in scheme with different <code>Kind</code> values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/register.go#L63-L77\">Dynamic resource registration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, we got a config where you can pass all possible types and specify what they should map to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/packages/system/cozystack-api/templates/configmap.yaml\">ConfigMap example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implement-our-own-registry\">Implement our own registry</h3>\n<p>To store state not in etcd but translate it directly into Kubernetes HelmRelease resources (and vice versa),\nwe wrote conversion functions from Application to HelmRelease and from HelmRelease to Application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L920-L991\">Conversion functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We implemented logic to filter resources by chart name, <code>sourceRef</code>, and prefix in the HelmRelease name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L747-L784\">Filtering functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, using this logic, we implemented the methods <code>Get()</code>, <code>Delete()</code>, <code>List()</code>, <code>Create()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can see the full example here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go\">Registry Implementation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of each method, we set the correct <code>Kind</code> and return an <code>unstructured.Unstructured{}</code> object\nso that Kubernetes serializes the object correctly.

In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder,\nproviding a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create\na project structure and generate code for your resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver\">sample-apiserver</a>:\nA ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries,\nwhich you can use as a foundation for your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For practical reasons, we chose the second project. Here's what we needed to do:</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-etcd-support\">Disable etcd support</h3>\n<p>In our case, we don't need it since all resources are stored directly in the Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>You can disable etcd options by passing nil to <code>RecommendedOptions.Etcd</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/cmd/server/start.go#L70\">Disabling etcd options</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"generate-a-common-resource-kind\">Generate a common resource kind</h3>\n<p>We called it Application, and it looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/types.go\">Application type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a generic type used for any application type, and its handling logic is the same for all charts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-configuration-loading\">Configure configuration loading</h3>\n<p>Since we want to configure our extension api-server via a config file, we formed the config structure in Go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/config/config.go\">Config type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also modified the resource registration logic so that the resources we create are registered in scheme with different <code>Kind</code> values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/register.go#L63-L77\">Dynamic resource registration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, we got a config where you can pass all possible types and specify what they should map to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/packages/system/cozystack-api/templates/configmap.yaml\">ConfigMap example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implement-our-own-registry\">Implement our own registry</h3>\n<p>To store state not in etcd but translate it directly into Kubernetes HelmRelease resources (and vice versa),\nwe wrote conversion functions from Application to HelmRelease and from HelmRelease to Application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L920-L991\">Conversion functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We implemented logic to filter resources by chart name, <code>sourceRef</code>, and prefix in the HelmRelease name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L747-L784\">Filtering functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, using this logic, we implemented the methods <code>Get()</code>, <code>Delete()</code>, <code>List()</code>, <code>Create()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can see the full example here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go\">Registry Implementation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of each method, we set the correct <code>Kind</code> and return an <code>unstructured.Unstructured{}</code> object\nso that Kubernetes serializes the object correctly. Otherwise,\nit would always serialize them with <code>kind: Application</code>, which we don't want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-we-achieve\">What did we achieve?</h2>\n<p>In Cozystack, all our types from

In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder,\nproviding a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create\na project structure and generate code for your resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver\">sample-apiserver</a>:\nA ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries,\nwhich you can use as a foundation for your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For practical reasons, we chose the second project. Here's what we needed to do:</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-etcd-support\">Disable etcd support</h3>\n<p>In our case, we don't need it since all resources are stored directly in the Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>You can disable etcd options by passing nil to <code>RecommendedOptions.Etcd</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/cmd/server/start.go#L70\">Disabling etcd options</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"generate-a-common-resource-kind\">Generate a common resource kind</h3>\n<p>We called it Application, and it looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/types.go\">Application type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a generic type used for any application type, and its handling logic is the same for all charts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-configuration-loading\">Configure configuration loading</h3>\n<p>Since we want to configure our extension api-server via a config file, we formed the config structure in Go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/config/config.go\">Config type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also modified the resource registration logic so that the resources we create are registered in scheme with different <code>Kind</code> values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/register.go#L63-L77\">Dynamic resource registration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, we got a config where you can pass all possible types and specify what they should map to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/packages/system/cozystack-api/templates/configmap.yaml\">ConfigMap example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implement-our-own-registry\">Implement our own registry</h3>\n<p>To store state not in etcd but translate it directly into Kubernetes HelmRelease resources (and vice versa),\nwe wrote conversion functions from Application to HelmRelease and from HelmRelease to Application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L920-L991\">Conversion functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We implemented logic to filter resources by chart name, <code>sourceRef</code>, and prefix in the HelmRelease name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L747-L784\">Filtering functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, using this logic, we implemented the methods <code>Get()</code>, <code>Delete()</code>, <code>List()</code>, <code>Create()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can see the full example here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go\">Registry Implementation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of each method, we set the correct <code>Kind</code> and return an <code>unstructured.Unstructured{}</code> object\nso that Kubernetes serializes the object correctly. Otherwise,\nit would always serialize them with <code>kind: Application</code>, which we don't want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-we-achieve\">What did we achieve?</h2>\n<p>In Cozystack, all our types from

In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years.

In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder,\nproviding a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create\na project structure and generate code for your resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver\">sample-apiserver</a>:\nA ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries,\nwhich you can use as a foundation for your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For practical reasons, we chose the second project.

In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server\nin the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You're probably already\nfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">controller</a> concept\nand frameworks like <a href=\"https://book.kubebuilder.io/\">kubebuilder</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sdk.operatorframework.io/\">operator-sdk</a> that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they\nallow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional\ncontrollers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources.\nThis approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your\nown operators.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the only way to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/#api-extensions\">extend the Kubernetes API</a>.\nFor more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic,\nmanaging subresources, and dynamically generating responses\u2014the Kubernetes API <em>aggregation layer</em>\nprovides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom\nextension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited\nto address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement\nour own extension API server in Cozystack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-api-aggregation-layer\">What Is the API Aggregation Layer?</h2>\n<p>First, let's get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/\">API aggregation layer</a>\nis a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an\nAPI server for the aggregation layer. An extension API server is just like the standard Kubernetes API server, except it runs separately and handles requests for your specific resource types.</p>\n<p>So, the aggregation layer lets you write your own extension API server, integrate it easily into Kubernetes,\nand directly process requests for resources in a certain group. Unlike the CRD mechanism, the extension API\nis registered in Kubernetes as an APIService, telling Kubernetes to consider this new API server and acknowledge\nthat it serves certain APIs.</p>\n<p>You can execute this command to list all registered apiservices:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example APIService:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME SERVICE AVAILABLE AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io cozy-system/cozystack-api True 7h29m\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As soon as the Kubernetes api-server receives requests for resources in the group\n<code>v1alpha1.apps.cozystack.io</code>, it redirects all those requests to our extension api-server,\nwhich can handle them based on the business logic we've built into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>The API Aggregation Layer helps solve several issues where the usual CRD mechanism might\nnot enough. Let's break them down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imperative-logic-and-subresources\">Imperative Logic and Subresources</h3>\n<p>Besides regular resources, Kubernetes also has something called subresources.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes, subresources are additional actions or operations you can perform on primary resources\n(like Pods, Deployments, Services) via the Kubernetes API. They provide interfaces to manage\nspecific aspects of resources without affecting the entire object.</p>\n<p>A simple example is <code>status</code>, which is traditionally exposed as a separate subresource that you can\naccess independently from the parent object. The <code>status</code> field isn't meant to be changed</p>\n<p>But beyond <code>/status</code>, Pods in Kubernetes also have subresources like <code>/exec</code>, <code>/portforward</code>, and\n<code>/log</code>. Interestingly, instead of the usual declarative resources in Kubernetes, these represent\nendpoints for imperative operations like viewing logs, proxying connections, executing commands in\na running container, and so on.</p>\n<p>To support such imperative commands on your own API, you need implement an extension API and an\nextension API server. Here are some well-known examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KubeVirt</strong>: An add-on for Kubernetes that extends its API capabilities to run traditional virtual machines.\nThe extension api-server created as part of KubeVirt handles subresources\nlike <code>/restart</code>, <code>/console</code>, and <code>/vnc</code> for virtual machines.</li>\n<li><strong>Knative</strong>: A Kubernetes add-on that extends its capabilities for serverless computing,\nimplementing the <code>/scale</code> subresource to set up autoscaling for its resource types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, even though subresource logic in Kubernetes can be <em>imperative</em>, you can manage access\nto them <em>declaratively</em> using Kubernetes standard RBAC model.</p>\n<p>For example this way you can control access to the <code>/log</code> and <code>/exec</code> subresources of the Pod kind:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Role<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">namespace</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>default<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>pod-and-pod-logs-reader<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">rules</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/log\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"get\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"list\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiGroups</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pods/exec\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">verbs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"create\"</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"you-re-not-tied-to-use-etcd\">You're not tied to use etcd</h3>\n<p>Usually, the Kubernetes API server uses <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">etcd</a> for its backend.\nHowever, implementing your own API server doesn't lock you into using only etcd.\nIf it doesn't make sense to store your server's state in etcd, you can store information in any\nother system and generate responses on the fly. Here are a few cases to illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a> is a standard extension for Kubernetes\nwhich allows you to view real-time metrics of your nodes and pods. It defines alternative Pod and Node\nkinds in its own metrics.k8s.io API. Requests to these resources are translated into metrics\ndirectly from Kubelet. So when you run <code>kubectl top node</code> or <code>kubectl top pod</code>, metrics-server fetches\nmetrics from cAdvisor in real-time. It then returns these metrics to you. Since the information\nis generated in real-time and is only relevant at the moment of the request, there is no need\nto store it in etcd. This approach saves resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, you can use a backend other than etcd. You can even implement a Kubernetes-compatible API\nfor it. For example, if you use Postgres, you can create a transparent representation of its entities\nin the Kubernetes API. Eg. databases, users, and grants within Postgres would appear as regular\nKubernetes resources, thanks to your extension API server. You could manage them using <code>kubectl</code> or any\nother Kubernetes-compatible tool. Unlike controllers, which implement business logic using custom resources\nand reconciliation methods, an extension API server eliminates the need for separate controllers for every kind.\nThis means you don't have to sync state between the Kubernetes API and your backend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-time-resources\">One-Time resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</p>\n<p>If you try to run <code>kubectl get selfsubjectaccessreviews</code> directly, you'll just get an error\nlike this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Error from server (MethodNotAllowed): the server does not allow this method on the requested resource\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason is that the Kubernetes API server doesn't support any other interaction with this\ntype of resource (you can only CREATE them).</p>\n<p>The SelfSubjectAccessReview API supports commands such as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace dev\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you run the command above, <code>kubectl</code> creates a SelfSubjectAccessReview using the\nKubernetes API. This allows Kubernetes to fetch a list of possible permissions for your user.\nKubernetes then generates a personalized response to your request in real-time. This logic is\ndifferent from a scenario where this resource is simply stored in etcd.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, in KubeVirt's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer\">CDI (Containerized Data Importer)</a>\nextension, which allows file uploads into a PVC from a local machine using the <code>virtctl</code> tool,\na special token is required before the upload process begins.\nThis token is generated by creating an UploadTokenRequest resource via the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes\nroutes (proxies) all UploadTokenRequest resource creation requests to the CDI extension API server,\nwhich generates and returns the token in response.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"full-control-over-conversion-validation-and-output-formatting\">Full control over conversion, validation, and output formatting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your own API server can have all the capabilities of the vanilla Kubernetes API server. The resources you create\nin your API server can be validated immediately on the server side without additional webhooks.\nWhile CRDs also support server-side validation using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a>\nfor declarative validation and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>\nwithout the need for webhooks, a custom API server allows for more complex and tailored validation logic if needed.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to serve multiple API versions for each resource type, traditionally\n<code>v1alpha1</code>, <code>v1beta1</code> and <code>v1</code>. Only one version can be specified as the storage version.\nAll requests to other versions must be automatically converted to the version specified as storage version.\nWith CRDs, this mechanism is implemented using conversion webhooks. Whereas in an extension API server,\nyou can implement your own conversion mechanism, choose to mix up different storage versions (one\nobject might be serialized as <code>v1</code>, another as <code>v2</code>), or rely on an external backing API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directly implementing the Kubernetes API lets you format table output however you like and doesn't force you to follow\nthe <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code> logic in CRDs. Instead, you can write your own formatter that\nformats the table output and custom fields in it. For example, when using <code>additionalPrinterColumns</code>,\nyou can display field values only following the JSONPath logic. In your own API server, you can generate\nand insert values on the fly, formatting the table output as you wish.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-registration\">Dynamic resource registration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The resources served by an extension api-server don't need to be pre-registered as CRDs.\nOnce your extension API server is registered using an APIService, Kubernetes starts polling it to discover\nAPIs and resources it can serve. After receiving a discovery response, the Kubernetes API server automatically\nregisters all available types for this API group.\nAlthough this isn't considered common practice, you can implement logic that dynamically registers\nthe resource types you need in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-not-to-use-the-api-aggregation-layer\">When not to use the API Aggregation Layer</h2>\n<p>There are some anti-patterns where using the API Aggregation Layer isn't recommended.\nLet's go through them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstable-backend\">Unstable backend</h3>\n<p>If your API server stops responding for some reason due to an unavailable backend or other issues it\nmay block some Kubernetes functionality. For example, when deleting namespaces, Kubernetes will wait\nfor a response from your API server to see if there are any remaining resources.\nIf the response doesn't come, the namespace deletion will be blocked.</p>\n<p>Also, you might have encountered a <a href=\"https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4224\">situation</a> where,\nwhen the metrics-server is unavailable, an extra message appears in stderr after every API request\n(even unrelated to metrics) stating that <code>metrics.k8s.io</code> is unavailable. This is another example\nof how using the API Aggregation Layer can lead to problems when the api-server handling requests\nis unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slow-requests\">Slow requests</h3>\n<p>If you can't guarantee an instant response for user requests, it's better to consider using a\nCustomResourceDefinition and controller.\nOtherwise, you might make your cluster less stable. Many projects implement an extension\nAPI server only for a limited set of resources, particularly for imperative logic and subresources.\nThis recommendation is also\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/#response-latency\">mentioned</a>\nin the official Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-we-needed-it-in-cozystack\">Why we needed it in Cozystack</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, we're developing the open-source PaaS platform <a href=\"https://cozystack.io/\">Cozystack</a>,\nwhich can also be used as a framework for building your own private cloud. Therefore, the ability\nto easily extend the platform is crucial for us.</p>\n<p>Cozystack is built on top of <a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/\">FluxCD</a>. Any application is packaged into its\nown Helm chart, ready for deployment in a tenant namespace. Deploying any application on the platform\nis done by creating a HelmRelease resource, specifying the chart name and parameters for the application.\nAll the rest logic is handled by FluxCD. This pattern allows us to easily extend the platform with new\napplications and provide the ability to create new applications that just need to be packaged\ninto the appropriate Helm chart.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Interface of the Cozystack platform\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/11/21/dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-cozystack/cozystack.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Interface of the Cozystack platform</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, in our platform, everything is configured as HelmRelease resources. However, we ran into\ntwo problems: limitations of the RBAC model and the need for a public API. Let's delve into these</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-the-rbac-model\">Limitations of the RBAC model</h3>\n<p>The widely-deployed RBAC system in Kubernetes doesn't allow you to restrict access to a list of resources\nof the same kind based on labels or specific fields in the spec. When creating a role, you can limit\naccess across the resources in the same kind only by specifying specific resource names in <code>resourceNames</code>.\nFor verbs like <strong>get</strong> or <strong>update</strong> it will work. However, filtering by <code>resourceNames</code> using <strong>list</strong>\nverb doesn't work like that. Thus you can limit listing certain resources by kind but not by name.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes has a special API used to provide users with information about their permissions.\nThis is implemented using the SelfSubjectAccessReview API. One unusual detail of these\nresources is that you can't view them using <strong>get</strong> or <strong>list</strong> verbs. You can only create them (using\nthe <strong>create</strong> verb) and receive output with information about what you have access to at that\nmoment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we decided to introduce new resource types based on the names of the Helm charts they use and\ngenerate the list of available kinds dynamically at runtime in our extension api-server.\nThis way, we can reuse Kubernetes standard RBAC model to manage access to specific resource types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"need-for-a-public-api\">Need for a public API</h3>\n<p>Since our platform provides capabilities for deploying various managed services, we want to organize\npublic access to the platform's API. However, we can't allow users to interact directly with resources\nlike HelmRelease because that would let them specify arbitrary names and parameters for Helm charts to\ndeploy, potentially compromising our system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to give users the ability to deploy a specific service simply by creating the resource with corresponding\nkind in Kubernetes. The type of this resource should be named the same as the chart from\nwhich it's deployed. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kind: Kubernetes</code> \u2192 <code>chart: kubernetes</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Postgres</code> \u2192 <code>chart: postgres</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: Redis</code> \u2192 <code>chart: redis</code></li>\n<li><code>kind: VirtualMachine</code> \u2192 <code>chart: virtual-machine</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we don't want to have to add a new type to codegen and recompile our extension API server\nevery time we add a new chart for it to start being served.\nThe schema update should be done dynamically or provided via a ConfigMap by the administrator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-conversion\">Two-Way conversion</h3>\n<p>Currently, we already have integrations and a dashboard that continue to use HelmRelease resources.\nAt this stage, we didn't want to lose the ability to support this API. Considering that we're simply\ntranslating one resource into another, support is maintained and it works both ways.\nIf you create a HelmRelease, you'll get a custom resource in Kubernetes, and if you create a\ncustom resource in Kubernetes, it will also be available as a HelmRelease.</p>\n<p>We don't have any additional controllers that synchronize state between these resources.\nAll requests to resources in our extension API server are transparently proxied to HelmRelease and vice versa.\nThis eliminates intermediate states and the need to write controllers and synchronization logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement the Aggregation API, you might consider starting with the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-builder-alpha\">apiserver-builder</a>:\nCurrently in alpha and hasn't been updated for two years. It works like kubebuilder,\nproviding a framework for creating an extension API server, allowing you to sequentially create\na project structure and generate code for your resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver\">sample-apiserver</a>:\nA ready-made example of an implemented API server, based on official Kubernetes libraries,\nwhich you can use as a foundation for your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For practical reasons, we chose the second project. Here's what we needed to do:</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-etcd-support\">Disable etcd support</h3>\n<p>In our case, we don't need it since all resources are stored directly in the Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>You can disable etcd options by passing nil to <code>RecommendedOptions.Etcd</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/cmd/server/start.go#L70\">Disabling etcd options</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"generate-a-common-resource-kind\">Generate a common resource kind</h3>\n<p>We called it Application, and it looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/types.go\">Application type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a generic type used for any application type, and its handling logic is the same for all charts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-configuration-loading\">Configure configuration loading</h3>\n<p>Since we want to configure our extension api-server via a config file, we formed the config structure in Go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/config/config.go\">Config type definition</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also modified the resource registration logic so that the resources we create are registered in scheme with different <code>Kind</code> values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/apis/apps/v1alpha1/register.go#L63-L77\">Dynamic resource registration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, we got a config where you can pass all possible types and specify what they should map to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/packages/system/cozystack-api/templates/configmap.yaml\">ConfigMap example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implement-our-own-registry\">Implement our own registry</h3>\n<p>To store state not in etcd but translate it directly into Kubernetes HelmRelease resources (and vice versa),\nwe wrote conversion functions from Application to HelmRelease and from HelmRelease to Application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L920-L991\">Conversion functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We implemented logic to filter resources by chart name, <code>sourceRef</code>, and prefix in the HelmRelease name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go#L747-L784\">Filtering functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, using this logic, we implemented the methods <code>Get()</code>, <code>Delete()</code>, <code>List()</code>, <code>Create()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can see the full example here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aenix-io/cozystack/blob/003edf8cf0a419bd67cd822d61ff806db49e7026/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go\">Registry Implementation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of each method, we set the correct <code>Kind</code> and return an <code>unstructured.Unstructured{}</code> object\nso that Kubernetes serializes the object correctly.

      "summary": "The Kubernetes project outlines planned changes for version 1.",
      "summary_original": "As we get closer to the release date for Kubernetes v1.32, the project develops and matures. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project's overall health. This blog outlines some of the planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.32 release, that the release team feels you should be aware of, for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment and keeping up to date with the latest changes. Information listed below is based on the current status of the v1.32 release and may change before the actual release date. The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation). Its usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, so you must migrate to use the replacement instead. Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes. Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation. Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place. Whether an API is removed due to a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the deprecation guide. Note on the withdrawal of the old DRA implementation The enhancement #3063 introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in Kubernetes 1.26. However, in Kubernetes v1.32, this approach to DRA will be significantly changed. Code related to the original implementation will be removed, leaving KEP #4381 as the \"new\" base functionality. The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource availability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers. The newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality. This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing the complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver. Please also see the enhancement issue #3063 to find out more. API removal There is only a single API removal planned for Kubernetes v1.32: The flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed. To prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since v1.29. All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares field only defaults to 30 when unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30. For more information, please refer to the API deprecation guide. Sneak peek of Kubernetes v1.32 The following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the v1.32 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. Even more DRA enhancements! In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters. This release introduces improvements, including the addition of resource health status in the Pod status, as outlined in KEP #4680. Add resource health status to the Pod status It isn't easy to know when a Pod uses a device that has failed or is temporarily unhealthy. KEP #4680 proposes exposing device health via Pod status, making troubleshooting of Pod crashes easier. Windows strikes back! KEP #4802 adds support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters. Before this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes but lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system shutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated, allowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability of clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates. Allow special characters in environment variables With the graduation of this enhancement to beta, Kubernetes now allows almost all printable ASCII characters (excluding \"=\") to be used as environment variable names. This change addresses the limitations previously imposed on variable naming, facilitating a broader adoption of Kubernetes by accommodating various application needs. The relaxed validation will be enabled by default via the RelaxedEnvironmentVariableValidation feature gate, ensuring that users can easily utilize environment variables without strict constraints, enhancing flexibility for developers working with applications like .NET Core that require special characters in their configurations. Make Kubernetes aware of the LoadBalancer behavior KEP #1860 graduates to GA, introducing the ipMode field for a Service of type: LoadBalancer, which can be set to either \"VIP\" or \"Proxy\". This enhancement is aimed at improving how cloud providers load balancers interact with kube-proxy and it is a change transparent to the end user. The existing behavior of kube-proxy is preserved when using \"VIP\", where kube-proxy handles the load balancing. Using \"Proxy\" results in traffic sent directly to the load balancer, providing cloud providers greater control over relying on kube-proxy; this means that you could see an improvement in the performance of your load balancer for some cloud providers. Retry generate name for resources This enhancement improves how name conflicts are handled for Kubernetes resources created with the generateName field. Previously, if a name conflict occurred, the API server returned a 409 HTTP Conflict error and clients had to manually retry the request. With this update, the API server automatically retries generating a new name up to seven times in case of a conflict. This significantly reduces the chances of collision, ensuring smooth generation of up to 1 million names with less than a 0.1% probability of a conflict, providing more resilience for large-scale workloads. Want to know more? New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.32 as part of the CHANGELOG for this release.

      "summary": "Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan is an initiative to lower barriers for new contributors and increase community involvement through annual co-located events.",
      "summary_original": "We are organizers of Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan. Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly. What is Kubernetes upstream training in Japan? Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes: Introduction to Kubernetes community Overview of Kubernetes codebase and how to create your first PR Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers, such as language How to set up the development environment Hands-on session using kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair. Additionally, we introduce the communication tools we primarily use, such as Slack, GitHub, and mailing lists. Some Japanese speakers may feel that communicating in English is a barrier. Additionally, those who are new to the community need to understand where and how communication takes place. We emphasize the importance of taking that first step, which is the most important aspect we focus on in our training! We then go over the structure of Kubernetes codebase, the main repositories, how to create a PR, and the CI/CD process using Prow. We explain in detail the process from creating a PR to getting it merged. After several lectures, participants get to experience hands-on work using kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground, where they can create a simple PR. The goal is for participants to get a feel for the process of contributing to Kubernetes. At the end of the program, we also provide a detailed explanation of setting up the development environment for contributing to the kubernetes/kubernetes repository, including building code locally, running tests efficiently, and setting up clusters. Interview with participants We conducted interviews with those who participated in our training program. We asked them about their reasons for joining, their impressions, and their future goals. Keita Mochizuki (NTT DATA Group Corporation) Keita Mochizuki is a contributor who consistently contributes to Kubernetes and related projects. Keita is also a professional in container security and has recently published a book. Additionally, he has made available a Roadmap for New Contributors, which is highly beneficial for those new to contributing. Junya: Why did you decide to participate in Kubernetes Upstream Training? Keita: Actually, I participated twice, in 2020 and 2022. In 2020, I had just started learning about Kubernetes and wanted to try getting involved in activities outside of work, so I signed up after seeing the event on Twitter by chance. However, I didn't have much knowledge at the time, and contributing to OSS felt like something beyond my reach. As a result, my understanding after the training was shallow, and I left with more of a \"hmm, okay\" feeling. In 2022, I participated again when I was at a stage where I was seriously considering starting contributions. This time, I did prior research and was able to resolve my questions during the lectures, making it a very productive experience. Junya: How did you feel after participating? Keita: I felt that the significance of this training greatly depends on the participant's mindset. The training itself consists of general explanations and simple hands-on exercises, but it doesn't mean that attending the training will immediately lead to contributions. Junya: What is your purpose for contributing? Keita: My initial motivation was to \"gain a deep understanding of Kubernetes and build a track record,\" meaning \"contributing itself was the goal.\" Nowadays, I also contribute to address bugs or constraints I discover during my work. Additionally, through contributing, I've become less hesitant to analyze undocumented features directly from the source code. Junya: What has been challenging about contributing? Keita: The most difficult part was taking the first step. Contributing to OSS requires a certain level of knowledge, and leveraging resources like this training and support from others was essential. One phrase that stuck with me was, \"Once you take the first step, it becomes easier to move forward.\" Also, in terms of continuing contributions as part of my job, the most challenging aspect is presenting the outcomes as achievements. To keep contributing over time, it's important to align it with business goals and strategies, but upstream contributions don't always lead to immediate results that can be directly tied to performance. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure mutual understanding with managers and gain their support. Junya: What are your future goals? Keita: My goal is to contribute to areas with a larger impact. So far, I've mainly contributed by fixing smaller bugs as my primary focus was building a track record, but moving forward, I'd like to challenge myself with contributions that have a greater impact on Kubernetes users or that address issues related to my work. Recently, I've also been working on reflecting the changes I've made to the codebase into the official documentation, and I see this as a step toward achieving my goals. Junya: Thank you very much! Yoshiki Fujikane (CyberAgent, Inc.) Yoshiki Fujikane is one of the maintainers of PipeCD, a CNCF Sandbox project. In addition to developing new features for Kubernetes support in PipeCD, Yoshiki actively participates in community management and speaks at various technical conferences. Junya: Why did you decide to participate in the Kubernetes Upstream Training? Yoshiki: At the time I participated, I was still a student. I had only briefly worked with EKS, but I thought Kubernetes seemed complex yet cool, and I was casually interested in it. Back then, OSS felt like something out of reach, and upstream development for Kubernetes seemed incredibly daunting. While I had always been interested in OSS, I didn't know where to start. It was during this time that I learned about the Kubernetes Upstream Training and decided to take the challenge of contributing to Kubernetes. Junya: What were your impressions after participating? Yoshiki: I found it extremely valuable as a way to understand what it's like to be part of an OSS community. At the time, my English skills weren't very strong, so accessing primary sources of information felt like a big hurdle for me. Kubernetes is a very large project, and I didn't have a clear understanding of the overall structure, let alone what was necessary for contributing. The upstream training provided a Japanese explanation of the community structure and allowed me to gain hands-on experience with actual contributions. Thanks to the guidance I received, I was able to learn how to approach primary sources and use them as entry points for further investigation, which was incredibly helpful. This experience made me realize the importance of organizing and reviewing primary sources, and now I often dive into GitHub issues and documentation when something piques my interest. As a result, while I am no longer contributing to Kubernetes itself, the experience has been a great foundation for contributing to other projects. Junya: What areas are you currently contributing to, and what are the other projects you're involved in? Yoshiki: Right now, I'm no longer working with Kubernetes, but instead, I'm a maintainer of PipeCD, a CNCF Sandbox project. PipeCD is a CD tool that supports GitOps-style deployments for various application platforms. The tool originally started as an internal project at CyberAgent. With different teams adopting different platforms, PipeCD was developed to provide a unified CD platform with a consistent user experience. Currently, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform. Junya: What role do you play within the PipeCD team? Yoshiki: I work full-time on improving and developing Kubernetes-related features within the team. Since we provide PipeCD as a SaaS internally, my main focus is on adding new features and improving existing ones as part of that support. In addition to code contributions, I also contribute by giving talks at various events and managing community meetings to help grow the PipeCD community. Junya: Could you explain what kind of improvements or developments you are working on with regards to Kubernetes? Yoshiki: PipeCD supports GitOps and Progressive Delivery for Kubernetes, so I'm involved in the development of those features. Recently, I've been working on features that streamline deployments across multiple clusters. Junya: Have you encountered any challenges while contributing to OSS? Yoshiki: One challenge is developing features that maintain generality while meeting user use cases. When we receive feature requests while operating the internal SaaS, we first consider adding features to solve those issues. At the same time, we want PipeCD to be used by a broader audience as an OSS tool. So, I always think about whether a feature designed for one use case could be applied to another, ensuring the software remains flexible and widely usable. Junya: What are your goals moving forward? Yoshiki: I want to focus on expanding PipeCD's functionality. Currently, we are developing PipeCD under the slogan \"One CD for All.\" As I mentioned earlier, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform, but there are many other platforms out there, and new platforms may emerge in the future. For this reason, we are currently developing a plugin system that will allow users to extend PipeCD on their own, and I want to push this effort forward. I'm also working on features for multi-cluster deployments in Kubernetes, and I aim to continue making impactful contributions. Junya: Thank you very much! Future of Kubernetes upstream training We plan to continue hosting Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan and look forward to welcoming many new contributors. Our next session is scheduled to take place at the end of November during CloudNative Days Winter 2024. Moreover, our goal is to expand these training programs not only in Japan but also around the world. Kubernetes celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, and for the community to become even more active, it's crucial for people across the globe to continue contributing. While Upstream Training is already held in several regions, we aim to bring it to even more places. We hope that as more people join Kubernetes community and contribute, our community will become even more vibrant!",

investigation, which was incredibly helpful.\nThis experience made me realize the importance of organizing and reviewing primary sources, and now I often dive into GitHub issues and documentation when something piques my interest.\nAs a result, while I am no longer contributing to Kubernetes itself, the experience has been a great foundation for contributing to other projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What areas are you currently contributing to, and what are the other projects you're involved in?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> Right now, I'm no longer working with Kubernetes, but instead, I'm a maintainer of PipeCD, a CNCF Sandbox project.\nPipeCD is a CD tool that supports GitOps-style deployments for various application platforms.\nThe tool originally started as an internal project at CyberAgent.\nWith different teams adopting different platforms, PipeCD was developed to provide a unified CD platform with a consistent user experience.\nCurrently, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What role do you play within the PipeCD team?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I work full-time on improving and developing Kubernetes-related features within the team.\nSince we provide PipeCD as a SaaS internally, my main focus is on adding new features and improving existing ones as part of that support.\nIn addition to code contributions, I also contribute by giving talks at various events and managing community meetings to help grow the PipeCD community.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Could you explain what kind of improvements or developments you are working on with regards to Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> PipeCD supports GitOps and Progressive Delivery for Kubernetes, so I'm involved in the development of those features.\nRecently, I've been working on features that streamline deployments across multiple clusters.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Have you encountered any challenges while contributing to OSS?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> One challenge is developing features that maintain generality while meeting user use cases.\nWhen we receive feature requests while operating the internal SaaS, we first consider adding features to solve those issues.\nAt the same time, we want PipeCD to be used by a broader audience as an OSS tool.\nSo, I always think about whether a feature designed for one use case could be applied to another, ensuring the software remains flexible and widely usable.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What are your goals moving forward?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I want to focus on expanding PipeCD's functionality.\nCurrently, we are developing PipeCD under the slogan &quot;One CD for All.&quot;\nAs I mentioned earlier, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform, but there are many other platforms out there, and new platforms may emerge in the future.\nFor this reason, we are currently developing a plugin system that will allow users to extend PipeCD on their own, and I want to push this effort forward.\nI'm also working on features for multi-cluster deployments in Kubernetes, and I aim to continue making impactful contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Thank you very much!</p>\n<h2

in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year.\nInitially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit),\nbut we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan.</p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online.\nThe training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Kubernetes community</li>\n<li>Overview of Kubernetes codebase and how to create your first PR</li>\n<li>Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers, such as language</li>\n<li>How to set up the development environment</li>\n<li>Hands-on session using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground\">kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute.\nWe emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions!</p>\n<p>We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups.\nNext, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.\nAdditionally, we introduce the communication tools we primarily use, such as Slack, GitHub, and mailing lists.\nSome Japanese speakers may feel that communicating in English is a barrier.\nAdditionally, those who are new to the community need to understand where and how communication takes place.\nWe emphasize the importance of taking that first step, which is the most important aspect we focus on in our training!</p>\n<p>We then go over the structure of Kubernetes codebase, the main repositories, how to create a PR, and the CI/CD process using <a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a>.\nWe explain in detail the process from creating a PR to getting it merged.</p>\n<p>After several lectures, participants get to experience hands-on work using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground\">kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground</a>, where they can create a simple PR.\nThe goal is for participants to get a feel for the process of contributing to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, we also provide a detailed explanation of setting up the development environment for contributing to the <code>kubernetes/kubernetes</code> repository,\nincluding building code locally, running tests efficiently, and setting up clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interview-with-participants\">Interview with participants</h2>\n<p>We conducted interviews with those who participated in our training program.\nWe asked them about their reasons for joining, their impressions, and their future goals.</p>\n<h3

href=\"https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/about-us/profile\">NTT DATA Group Corporation</a>)</h3>\n<p>Keita Mochizuki is a contributor who consistently contributes to Kubernetes and related projects.\nKeita is also a professional in container security and has recently published a book.\nAdditionally, he has made available a <a href=\"https://github.com/mochizuki875/KubernetesFirstContributionRoadMap\">Roadmap for New Contributors</a>, which is highly beneficial for those new to contributing.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Why did you decide to participate in Kubernetes Upstream Training?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> Actually, I participated twice, in 2020 and 2022.\nIn 2020, I had just started learning about Kubernetes and wanted to try getting involved in activities outside of work, so I signed up after seeing the event on Twitter by chance.\nHowever, I didn't have much knowledge at the time, and contributing to OSS felt like something beyond my reach.\nAs a result, my understanding after the training was shallow, and I left with more of a &quot;hmm, okay&quot; feeling.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I participated again when I was at a stage where I was seriously considering starting contributions.\nThis time, I did prior research and was able to resolve my questions during the lectures, making it a very productive experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> How did you feel after participating?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> I felt that the significance of this training greatly depends on the participant's mindset.\nThe training itself consists of general explanations and simple hands-on exercises, but it doesn't mean that attending the training will immediately lead to contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What is your purpose for contributing?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> My initial motivation was to &quot;gain a deep understanding of Kubernetes and build a track record,&quot; meaning &quot;contributing itself was the goal.&quot;\nNowadays, I also contribute to address bugs or constraints I discover during my work.\nAdditionally, through contributing, I've become less hesitant to analyze undocumented features directly from the source code.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What has been challenging about contributing?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> The most difficult part was taking the first step. Contributing to OSS requires a certain level of knowledge, and leveraging resources like this training and support from others was essential.\nOne phrase that stuck with me was, &quot;Once you take the first step, it becomes easier to move forward.&quot;\nAlso, in terms of continuing contributions as part of my job, the most challenging aspect is presenting the outcomes as achievements.\nTo keep contributing over time, it's important to align it with business goals and strategies, but upstream contributions don't always lead to immediate results that can be directly tied to performance.\nTherefore, it's crucial to ensure mutual understanding with managers and gain their support.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What are your future goals?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> My goal is to contribute to areas with a larger impact.\nSo far, I've mainly contributed by fixing smaller bugs as my primary focus was building a track record,\nbut moving forward, I'd like to challenge myself with contributions that have a greater impact on Kubernetes users or that address issues related to my work.\nRecently, I've also been working on reflecting the changes I've made to the codebase into the official documentation,\nand I see this as a step toward achieving my goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Thank you very much!</p>\n<h3

you decide to participate in the Kubernetes Upstream Training?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> At the time I participated, I was still a student.\nI had only briefly worked with EKS, but I thought Kubernetes seemed complex yet cool, and I was casually interested in it.\nBack then, OSS felt like something out of reach, and upstream development for Kubernetes seemed incredibly daunting.\nWhile I had always been interested in OSS, I didn't know where to start.\nIt was during this time that I learned about the Kubernetes Upstream Training and decided to take the challenge of contributing to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What were your impressions after participating?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I found it extremely valuable as a way to understand what it's like to be part of an OSS community.\nAt the time, my English skills weren't very strong, so accessing primary sources of information felt like a big hurdle for me.\nKubernetes is a very large project, and I

training in Japan?</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Upstream Training in 2022\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/10/28/k8s-upstream-training-japan-spotlight/ood-2022-01.png\" /></p>\n<p>Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year.\nInitially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit),\nbut we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan.</p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online.\nThe training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Kubernetes community</li>\n<li>Overview of Kubernetes codebase and how to create your first PR</li>\n<li>Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers, such as language</li>\n<li>How to set up the development environment</li>\n<li>Hands-on session using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground\">kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute.\nWe emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions!</p>\n<p>We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups.\nNext, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.\nAdditionally, we introduce the communication tools we primarily use, such as Slack, GitHub, and mailing lists.\nSome Japanese speakers may feel that communicating in English is a barrier.\nAdditionally, those who are new to the community need to understand where and how communication takes place.\nWe emphasize the importance of taking that first step, which is the most important aspect we focus on in our training!</p>\n<p>We then go over the structure of Kubernetes codebase, the main repositories, how to create a PR, and the CI/CD process using <a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a>.\nWe explain in detail the process from creating a PR to getting it merged.</p>\n<p>After several lectures, participants get to experience hands-on work using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground\">kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground</a>, where they can create a simple PR.\nThe goal is for participants to get a feel for the process of contributing to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, we also provide a detailed explanation of setting up the development environment for contributing to the <code>kubernetes/kubernetes</code> repository,\nincluding building code locally, running tests efficiently, and setting up clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interview-with-participants\">Interview with participants</h2>\n<p>We conducted interviews with those who participated in our training program.\nWe asked them about their reasons for joining, their impressions, and their future goals.</p>\n<h3

href=\"https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/about-us/profile\">NTT DATA Group Corporation</a>)</h3>\n<p>Keita Mochizuki is a contributor who consistently contributes to Kubernetes and related projects.\nKeita is also a professional in container security and has recently published a book.\nAdditionally, he has made available a <a href=\"https://github.com/mochizuki875/KubernetesFirstContributionRoadMap\">Roadmap for New Contributors</a>, which is highly beneficial for those new to contributing.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Why did you decide to participate in Kubernetes Upstream Training?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> Actually, I participated twice, in 2020 and 2022.\nIn 2020, I had just started learning about Kubernetes and wanted to try getting involved in activities outside of work, so I signed up after seeing the event on Twitter by chance.\nHowever, I didn't have much knowledge at the time, and contributing to OSS felt like something beyond my reach.\nAs a result, my understanding after the training was shallow, and I left with more of a &quot;hmm, okay&quot; feeling.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I participated again when I was at a stage where I was seriously considering starting contributions.\nThis time, I did prior research and was able to resolve my questions during the lectures, making it a very productive experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> How did you feel after participating?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> I felt that the significance of this training greatly depends on the participant's mindset.\nThe training itself consists of general explanations and simple hands-on exercises, but it doesn't mean that attending the training will immediately lead to contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What is your purpose for contributing?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> My initial motivation was to &quot;gain a deep understanding of Kubernetes and build a track record,&quot; meaning &quot;contributing itself was the goal.&quot;\nNowadays, I also contribute to address bugs or constraints I discover during my work.\nAdditionally, through contributing, I've become less hesitant to analyze undocumented features directly from the source code.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What has been challenging about contributing?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> The most difficult part was taking the first step. Contributing to OSS requires a certain level of knowledge, and leveraging resources like this training and support from others was essential.\nOne phrase that stuck with me was, &quot;Once you take the first step, it becomes easier to move forward.&quot;\nAlso, in terms of continuing contributions as part of my job, the most challenging aspect is presenting the outcomes as achievements.\nTo keep contributing over time, it's important to align it with business goals and strategies, but upstream contributions don't always lead to immediate results that can be directly tied to performance.\nTherefore, it's crucial to ensure mutual understanding with managers and gain their support.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What are your future goals?</p>\n<p><strong>Keita:</strong> My goal is to contribute to areas with a larger impact.\nSo far, I've mainly contributed by fixing smaller bugs as my primary focus was building a track record,\nbut moving forward, I'd like to challenge myself with contributions that have a greater impact on Kubernetes users or that address issues related to my work.\nRecently, I've also been working on reflecting the changes I've made to the codebase into the official documentation,\nand I see this as a step toward achieving my goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Thank you very much!</p>\n<h3

href=\"https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/en/\">CyberAgent, Inc.</a>)</h3>\n<p>Yoshiki Fujikane is one of the maintainers of <a href=\"https://pipecd.dev/\">PipeCD</a>, a CNCF Sandbox project.\nIn addition to developing new features for Kubernetes support in PipeCD,\nYoshiki actively participates in community management and speaks at various technical conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Why did you decide to participate in the Kubernetes Upstream Training?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> At the time I participated, I was still a student.\nI had only briefly worked with EKS, but I thought Kubernetes seemed complex yet cool, and I was casually interested in it.\nBack then, OSS felt like something out of reach, and upstream development for Kubernetes seemed incredibly daunting.\nWhile I had always been interested in OSS, I didn't know where to start.\nIt was during this time that I learned about the Kubernetes Upstream Training and decided to take the challenge of contributing to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What were your impressions after participating?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I found it extremely valuable as a way to understand what it's like to be part of an OSS community.\nAt the time, my English skills weren't very strong, so accessing primary sources of information felt like a big hurdle for me.\nKubernetes is a very large project, and I didn't have a clear understanding of the overall structure, let alone what was necessary for contributing.\nThe upstream training provided a Japanese explanation of the community structure and allowed me to gain hands-on experience with actual contributions.\nThanks to the guidance I received, I was able to learn how to approach primary sources and use them as entry points for further investigation, which was incredibly helpful.\nThis experience made me realize the importance of organizing and reviewing primary sources, and now I often dive into GitHub issues and documentation when something piques my interest.\nAs a result, while I am no longer contributing to Kubernetes itself, the experience has been a great foundation for contributing to other projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What areas are you currently contributing to, and what are the other projects you're involved in?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> Right now, I'm no longer working with Kubernetes, but instead, I'm a maintainer of PipeCD, a CNCF Sandbox project.\nPipeCD is a CD tool that supports GitOps-style deployments for various application platforms.\nThe tool originally started as an internal project at CyberAgent.\nWith different teams adopting different platforms, PipeCD was developed to provide a unified CD platform with a consistent user experience.\nCurrently, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What role do you play within the PipeCD team?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I work full-time on improving and developing Kubernetes-related features within the team.\nSince we provide PipeCD as a SaaS internally, my main focus is on adding new features and improving existing ones as part of that support.\nIn addition to code contributions, I also contribute by giving talks at various events and managing community meetings to help grow the PipeCD community.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Could you explain what kind of improvements or developments you are working on with regards to Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> PipeCD supports GitOps and Progressive Delivery for Kubernetes, so I'm involved in the development of those features.\nRecently, I've been working on features that streamline deployments across multiple clusters.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Have you encountered any challenges while contributing to OSS?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> One challenge is developing features that maintain generality while meeting user use cases.\nWhen we receive feature requests while operating the internal SaaS, we first consider adding features to solve those issues.\nAt the same time, we want PipeCD to be used by a broader audience as an OSS tool.\nSo, I always think about whether a feature designed for one use case could be applied to another, ensuring the software remains flexible and widely usable.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> What are your goals moving forward?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoshiki:</strong> I want to focus on expanding PipeCD's functionality.\nCurrently, we are developing PipeCD under the slogan &quot;One CD for All.&quot;\nAs I mentioned earlier, it supports Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, and Terraform, but there are many other platforms out there, and new platforms may emerge in the future.\nFor this reason, we are currently developing a plugin system that will allow users to extend PipeCD on their own, and I want to push this effort forward.\nI'm also working on features for multi-cluster deployments in Kubernetes, and I aim to continue making impactful contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Junya:</strong> Thank you very much!</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-of-kubernetes-upstream-training\">Future of Kubernetes upstream training</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue hosting Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan and look forward to welcoming many new contributors.\nOur next session is scheduled to take place at the end of November during <a href=\"https://event.cloudnativedays.jp/cndw2024\">CloudNative Days Winter 2024</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our goal is to expand these training programs not only in Japan but also around the world.\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/06/06/10-years-of-kubernetes/\">Kubernetes celebrated its 10th anniversary</a> this year, and for the community to become even more active, it's crucial for people across the globe to continue contributing.\nWhile Upstream Training is already held in several regions, we aim to bring it to even more places.</p>\n<p>We hope that as more people join Kubernetes community and contribute, our community will become even more vibrant!</p>"

      "summary_original": "In recognition of Deaf Awareness Month and the importance of inclusivity in the tech community, we are spotlighting Catherine Paganini, facilitator and one of the founding members of CNCF Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Working Group (DHHWG). In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar, a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team, sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep\u2019s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine\u2019s journey, the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers, and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects. Introduction Sandeep Kanabar (SK): Hello Catherine, could you please introduce yourself, share your professional background, and explain your connection to the Kubernetes ecosystem? Catherine Paganini (CP): I'm the Head of Marketing at Buoyant, the creator of Linkerd, the CNCF-graduated service mesh, and 5th CNCF project. Four years ago, I started contributing to open source. The initial motivation was to make cloud native concepts more accessible to newbies and non-technical people. Without a technical background, it was hard for me to understand what Kubernetes, containers, service meshes, etc. mean. All content was targeted at engineers already familiar with foundational concepts. Clearly, I couldn't be the only one struggling with wrapping my head around cloud native. My first contribution was the CNCF Landscape Guide, which I co-authored with my former colleague Jason Morgan. Next, we started the CNCF Glossary, which explains cloud native concepts in simple terms. Today, the glossary has been (partially) localised into 14 languages! Currently, I'm the co-chair of the TAG Contributor Strategy and the Facilitator of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Working Group (DHHWG) and Blind and Visually Impaired WG (BVIWG), which is still in formation. I'm also working on a new Linux Foundation (LF) initiative called ABIDE (Accessibility and Belonging through Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity), so stay tuned to learn more about it! Motivation and early milestones SK: That's inspiring! Building on your passion for accessibility, what motivated you to facilitate the creation of the DHHWG? Was there a speecifc moment or experience that sparked this initiative? CP: Last year at KubeCon Amsterdam, I learned about a great initiative by Jay Tihema that creates pathways for Maori youth into cloud native and open source. While telling my CODA (children of deaf adults) high school friend about it, I thought it'd be great to create something similar for deaf folks. A few months later, I posted about it in a LinkedIn post that the CNCF shared. Deaf people started to reach out, wanting to participate. And the rest is history. SK: Speaking of history, since its launch, how has the DHHWG evolved? Could you highlight some of the key milestones or achievements the group has reached recently? CP: Our WG is about a year old. It started with a few deaf engineers and me brainstorming how to make KubeCon more accessible. We published an initial draft of Best practices for an inclusive conference and shared it with the LF events team. KubeCon Chicago was two months later, and we had a couple of deaf attendees. It was the first KubeCon accessible to deaf signers. Destiny, one of our co-chairs, even participated in a keynote panel. It was incredible how quickly everything happened! DHHWG members at KubeCon Chicago The team has grown since then, and we've been able to do much more. With a kiosk in the project pavilion, an open space discussion, a sign language crash course, and a few media interviews, KubeCon Paris had a stronger advocacy and outreach focus. Check out this video of our team in Paris to get a glimpse of all the different KubeCon activities \u2014 it was such a great event! The team also launched the first CNCF Community Group in sign language, Deaf in Cloud Native, a glossary team that creates sign language videos for each technical term to help standardize technical signs across the globe. It's crazy to think that it all happened within one year! Overcoming challenges and addressing misconceptions SK: That's remarkable progress in just a year! Building such momentum must have come with its challenges. What barriers have you encountered in facilitating the DHHWG, and how did you and the group work to overcome them? CP: The support from the community, LF, and CNCF has been incredible. The fact that we achieved so much is proof of it. The challenges are more in helping some team members overcome their fear of contributing. Most are new to open source, and it can be intimidating to put your work out there for everyone to see. The fear of being criticized in public is real; however, as they will hopefully realize over time, our community is incredibly supportive. Instead of criticizing, people tend to help improve the work, leading to better outcomes. SK: Are there any misconceptions about the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in tech that you'd like to address? CP: Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are very diverse \u2014 there is no one-size-fits-all. Some deaf people are oral (speak), others sign, while some lip read or prefer captions. It generally depends on how people grew up. While some people come from deaf families and sign language is their native language, others were born into hearing families who may or may not have learned how to sign. Some deaf people grew up surrounded by hearing people, while others grew up deeply embedded in Deaf culture. Hard-of-hearing individuals, on the other hand, typically can communicate well with hearing peers one-on-one in quiet settings, but loud environments or conversations with multiple people can make it hard to follow the conversation. Most rely heavily on captions. Each background and experience will shape their communication style and preferences. In short, what works for one person, doesn't necessarily work for others. So never assume and always ask about accessibility needs and preferences. Impact and the role of allies SK: Can you share some key impacts/outcomes of the conference best practices document? CP: Here are the two most important ones: Captions should be on the monitor, not in an app. That's especially important during technical talks with live demos. Deaf and hard of hearing attendees will miss important information switching between captions on their phone and code on the screen. Interpreters are most valuable during networking, not in talks (with captions). Most people come to conferences for the hallway track. That is no different for deaf attendees. If they can't network, they are missing out on key professional connections, affecting their career prospects. SK: In your view, how crucial is the role of allies within the DHHWG, and what contributions have they made to the group\u2019s success? CP: Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are a minority and can only do so much. Allies are the key to any diversity and inclusion initiative. As a majority, allies can help spread the word and educate their peers, playing a key role in scaling advocacy efforts. They also have the power to demand change. It's easy for companies to ignore minorities, but if the majority demands that their employers be accessible, environmentally conscious, and good citizens, they will ultimately be pushed to adapt to new societal values. Expanding DEI efforts and future vision SK: The importance of allies in driving change is clear. Beyond the DHHWG, are you involved in any other DEI groups or initiatives within the tech community? CP: As mentioned above, I'm working on an initiative called ABIDE, which is still work in progress. I don't want to share too much about it yet, but what I can say is that the DHHWG will be part of it and that we just started a Blind and Visually Impaired WG (BVIWG). ABIDE will start by focusing on accessibility, so if anyone reading this has an idea for another WG, please reach out to me via the CNCF Slack @Catherine Paganini. SK: What does the future hold for the DHHWG? Can you share details about any ongoing or upcoming initiatives? CP: I think we've been very successful in terms of visibility and awareness so far. We can't stop, though. Awareness work is ongoing, and most people in our community haven't heard about us or met anyone on our team yet, so a lot of work still lies ahead. DHHWG members at KubeCon Paris The next step is to refocus on advocacy. The same thing we did with the conference best practices but for other areas. The goal is to help educate the community about what real accessibility looks like, how projects can be more accessible, and why employers should seriously consider deaf candidates while providing them with the tools they need to conduct successful interviews and employee onboarding. We need to capture all that in documents, publish it, and then get the word out. That last part is certainly the most challenging, but it's also where everyone can get involved. Call to action SK: Thank you for sharing your insights, Catherine. As we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or a call to action for our readers? CP: As we build our accessibility page, check in regularly to see what's new. Share the docs with your team, employer, and network \u2014 anyone, really. The more people understand what accessibility really means and why it matters, the more people will recognize when something isn't accessible, and be able to call out marketing-BS, which, unfortunately, is more often the case than not. We need allies to help push for change. No minority can do this on their own. So please learn about accessibility, keep an eye out for it, and call it out when something isn't accessible. We need your help! Wrapping up Catherine and the DHHWG's work exemplify the power of community and advocacy. As we celebrate Deaf Awareness Month, let's reflect on her role as an ally and consider how we can all contribute to building a more inclusive tech community, particularly within open-source projects like Kubernetes. Together, we can break down barriers, challenge misconceptions, and ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued. By advocating for accessibility, supporting initiatives like the DHHWG, and fostering a culture of empathy, we can create a truly inclusive and welcoming space for all.",

It was the <strong>first</strong> KubeCon accessible to deaf signers. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/destiny-o-connor-28b2a5255/\">Destiny</a>, one of our co-chairs, even participated in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3WJ_s4Jvbsk?si=iscthTiCyMxoMUqY&amp;t=347\">keynote panel</a>. It was incredible how quickly everything happened!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DHHWG members at KubeCon Chicago\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/09/30/cncf-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-working-group-spotlight/cncf-dhhwg-chicago.jpg\" />\n<em>DHHWG members at KubeCon Chicago</em></p>\n<p>The team has grown since then, and we've been able to do much more. With a kiosk in the project pavilion, an open space discussion, a sign language crash course, and a few media interviews, KubeCon Paris had a stronger advocacy and outreach focus. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8AcyqsgAyQ\">Check out this video of our team in Paris</a> to get a glimpse of all the different KubeCon activities \u2014 it was such a great event! The team also launched the first CNCF Community Group in sign language, <a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/deaf-in-cloud-native/\">Deaf in Cloud Native</a>, a glossary team that creates sign language videos for each technical term to help standardize technical signs across the globe. It's crazy to think that it all happened within one year!</p>\n<h2 id=\"overcoming-challenges-and-addressing-misconceptions\">Overcoming challenges and addressing misconceptions</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: That's remarkable progress in just a year! Building such momentum must have come with its challenges. What barriers have you encountered in facilitating the DHHWG, and how did you and the group work to overcome them?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: The support from the community, LF, and CNCF has been incredible. The fact that we achieved so much is proof of it. The challenges are more in helping some team members overcome their fear of contributing. Most are new to open source, and it can be intimidating to put your work out there for everyone to see. The fear of being criticized in public is real; however, as they will hopefully realize over time, our community is incredibly supportive. Instead of criticizing, people tend to help improve the work, leading to better outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: Are there any misconceptions about the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in tech that you'd like to address?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are very diverse \u2014 there is no one-size-fits-all. Some deaf people are oral (speak), others sign, while some lip read or prefer captions. It generally depends on how people grew up. While some people come from deaf families and sign language is their native language, others were born into hearing families who may or may not have learned how to sign. Some deaf people grew up surrounded by hearing people, while others grew up deeply embedded in Deaf culture. Hard-of-hearing individuals, on the other hand, typically can communicate well with hearing peers one-on-one in quiet settings, but loud environments or conversations with multiple people can make it hard to follow the conversation. Most rely heavily on captions. Each background and experience will shape their communication style and preferences. In short, what works for one person, doesn't necessarily work for others. So <strong>never assume</strong> and <strong>always ask</strong> about accessibility needs and preferences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"impact-and-the-role-of-allies\">Impact and the role of allies</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: Can you share some key impacts/outcomes of the conference best practices document?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Here are the two most important ones: Captions should be on the monitor, not in an app. That's especially important during technical talks with live demos. Deaf and hard of hearing attendees will miss important information switching between captions on their phone and code on the screen.</p>\n<p>Interpreters are most valuable during networking, not in talks (with captions). Most people come to conferences for the hallway track. That is no different for deaf attendees. If they can't network, they are missing out on key professional connections, affecting their career prospects.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: In your view, how crucial is the role of allies within the DHHWG, and what contributions have they made to the group\u2019s success?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are a minority and can only do so much. <em><strong>Allies are the key to any diversity and inclusion initiative</strong></em>. As a majority, allies can help spread the word and educate their peers, playing a key role in scaling advocacy efforts. They also have the power to demand change. It's easy for companies to ignore minorities, but if the majority demands that their employers be accessible, environmentally conscious, and good citizens, they will ultimately be pushed to adapt to new societal values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expanding-dei-efforts-and-future-vision\">Expanding DEI efforts and future vision</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: The importance of allies in driving change is clear. Beyond the DHHWG, are you involved in any other DEI groups or initiatives within the tech community?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: As mentioned above, I'm working on an initiative called ABIDE, which is still work in progress. I don't want to share too much about it yet, but what I can say is that the DHHWG will be part of it and that we just started a Blind and Visually Impaired WG (BVIWG). ABIDE will start by focusing on accessibility, so if anyone reading this has an idea for another WG, please reach out to me via the CNCF Slack @Catherine Paganini.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: What does the future hold for the DHHWG? Can you share details about any ongoing or upcoming initiatives?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: I think we've been very successful in terms of visibility and awareness so far. We can't stop, though. Awareness work is ongoing, and most people in our community haven't heard about us or met anyone on our team yet, so a lot of work still lies ahead.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DHHWG members at KubeCon Paris\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/09/30/cncf-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-working-group-spotlight/cncf-dhhwg-paris.jpg\" />\n<em>DHHWG members at KubeCon Paris</em></p>\n<p>The next step is to refocus on advocacy. The same thing we did with the conference best practices but for other areas. The goal is to help educate the community about what real accessibility looks like, how projects can be more accessible, and why employers should seriously consider deaf candidates while providing them with the tools they need to conduct successful interviews and employee onboarding. We need to capture all that in documents, publish it, and then get the word out. That last part is certainly the most challenging, but it's also where everyone can get involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call-to-action\">Call to action</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: Thank you for sharing your insights, Catherine. As we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or a call to action for our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: As we build our <a href=\"https://contribute.cncf.io/accessibility/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/\">accessibility page</a>, check in regularly to see what's new. Share the docs with your team, employer, and network \u2014 anyone, really. The more people understand what accessibility really means and why it matters, the more people will recognize when something isn't accessible, and be able to call out marketing-BS, which, unfortunately, is more often the case than not. We need allies to help push for change. <strong>No minority can do this on their own</strong>. So please learn about accessibility, keep an eye out for it, and call it out when something isn't accessible. We need your help!</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Catherine and the DHHWG's work exemplify the power of community and advocacy. As we celebrate Deaf Awareness Month, let's reflect on her role as an ally and consider how we can all contribute to building a more inclusive tech community, particularly within open-source projects like Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><em>Together, we can break down barriers, challenge misconceptions, and ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued.

Four years ago, I started contributing to open source. The initial motivation was to make cloud native concepts more accessible to newbies and non-technical people. Without a technical background, it was hard for me to understand what Kubernetes, containers, service meshes, etc. mean. All content was targeted at engineers already familiar with foundational concepts. Clearly, I couldn't be the only one struggling with wrapping my head around cloud native.</p>\n<p>My first contribution was the <a href=\"https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#introduction\">CNCF Landscape Guide</a>, which I co-authored with my former colleague Jason Morgan. Next, we started the <a href=\"https://glossary.cncf.io/\">CNCF Glossary</a>, which explains cloud native concepts in simple terms. Today, the glossary has been (partially) localised into 14 languages!</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm the co-chair of the <a href=\"https://contribute.cncf.io/about/\">TAG Contributor Strategy</a> and the Facilitator of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Working Group (DHHWG) and Blind and Visually Impaired WG (BVIWG), which is still in formation. I'm also working on a new Linux Foundation (LF) initiative called ABIDE (Accessibility and Belonging through Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity), so stay tuned to learn more about it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"motivation-and-early-milestones\">Motivation and early milestones</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: That's inspiring! Building on your passion for accessibility, what motivated you to facilitate the creation of the DHHWG? Was there a speecifc moment or experience that sparked this initiative?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Last year at KubeCon Amsterdam, I learned about a great initiative by Jay Tihema that creates <a href=\"https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/videos/2023/from-maori-to-deaf-engineers/\">pathways for Maori youth into cloud native</a> and open source. While telling my CODA (children of deaf adults) high school friend about it, I thought it'd be great to create something similar for deaf folks. A few months later, I posted about it in a LinkedIn post that the CNCF shared. Deaf people started to reach out, wanting to participate. And the rest is history.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: Speaking of history, since its launch, how has the DHHWG evolved? Could you highlight some of the key milestones or achievements the group has reached recently?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Our WG is about a year old. It started with a few deaf engineers and me brainstorming how to make KubeCon more accessible.

Some deaf people grew up surrounded by hearing people, while others grew up deeply embedded in Deaf culture. Hard-of-hearing individuals, on the other hand, typically can communicate well with hearing peers one-on-one in quiet settings, but loud environments or conversations with multiple people can make it hard to follow the conversation. Most rely heavily on captions. Each background and experience will shape their communication style and preferences. In short, what works for one person, doesn't necessarily work for others. So <strong>never assume</strong> and <strong>always ask</strong> about accessibility needs and preferences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"impact-and-the-role-of-allies\">Impact and the role of allies</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: Can you share some key impacts/outcomes of the conference best practices document?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Here are the two most important ones: Captions should be on the monitor, not in an app. That's especially important during technical talks with live demos. Deaf and hard of hearing attendees will miss important information switching between captions on their phone and code on the screen.</p>\n<p>Interpreters are most valuable during networking, not in talks (with captions). Most people come to conferences for the hallway track. That is no different for deaf attendees. If they can't network, they are missing out on key professional connections, affecting their career prospects.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: In your view, how crucial is the role of allies within the DHHWG, and what contributions have they made to the group\u2019s success?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are a minority and can only do so much. <em><strong>Allies are the key to any diversity and inclusion initiative</strong></em>. As a majority, allies can help spread the word and educate their peers, playing a key role in scaling advocacy efforts. They also have the power to demand change. It's easy for companies to ignore minorities, but if the majority demands that their employers be accessible, environmentally conscious, and good citizens, they will ultimately be pushed to adapt to new societal values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expanding-dei-efforts-and-future-vision\">Expanding DEI efforts and future vision</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: The importance of allies in driving change is clear. Beyond the DHHWG, are you involved in any other DEI groups or initiatives within the tech community?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: As mentioned above, I'm working on an initiative called ABIDE, which is still work in progress. I don't want to share too much about it yet, but what I can say is that the DHHWG will be part of it and that we just started a Blind and Visually Impaired WG (BVIWG). ABIDE will start by focusing on accessibility, so if anyone reading this has an idea for another WG, please reach out to me via the CNCF Slack @Catherine Paganini.</p>\n<p><strong>SK: What does the future hold for the DHHWG? Can you share details about any ongoing or upcoming initiatives?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: I think we've been very successful in terms of visibility and awareness so far. We can't stop, though. Awareness work is ongoing, and most people in our community haven't heard about us or met anyone on our team yet, so a lot of work still lies ahead.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DHHWG members at KubeCon Paris\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/09/30/cncf-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-working-group-spotlight/cncf-dhhwg-paris.jpg\" />\n<em>DHHWG members at KubeCon Paris</em></p>\n<p>The next step is to refocus on advocacy. The same thing we did with the conference best practices but for other areas. The goal is to help educate the community about what real accessibility looks like, how projects can be more accessible, and why employers should seriously consider deaf candidates while providing them with the tools they need to conduct successful interviews and employee onboarding. We need to capture all that in documents, publish it, and then get the word out. That last part is certainly the most challenging, but it's also where everyone can get involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call-to-action\">Call to action</h2>\n<p><strong>SK: Thank you for sharing your insights, Catherine. As we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or a call to action for our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CP</strong>: As we build our <a href=\"https://contribute.cncf.io/accessibility/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/\">accessibility page</a>, check in regularly to see what's new. Share the docs with your team, employer, and network \u2014 anyone, really. The more people understand what accessibility really means and why it matters, the more people will recognize when something isn't accessible, and be able to call out marketing-BS, which, unfortunately, is more often the case than not. We need allies to help push for change. <strong>No minority can do this on their own</strong>. So please learn about accessibility, keep an eye out for it, and call it out when something isn't accessible. We need your help!</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Catherine and the DHHWG's work exemplify the power of community and advocacy. As we celebrate Deaf Awareness Month, let's reflect on her role as an ally and consider how we can all contribute to building a more inclusive tech community, particularly within open-source projects like Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><em>Together, we can break down barriers, challenge misconceptions, and ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued. By advocating for accessibility, supporting initiatives like the DHHWG, and fostering a culture of empathy, we can create a truly inclusive and welcoming space for all.</em></p>"

If you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks: Reddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced API fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for NSFW subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about NSFW topics). And worse, blind redditors & blind mods [including mods of r/Blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community.

There's just one glaring problem: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators. (If that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)
